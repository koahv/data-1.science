During this phase of testing, the company experimented with using a new airlock that helps test pods transition between atmospheric and vacuum conditions.
By combining magnetic levitation, extremely low aerodynamic drag, and the level of air pressure experienced at 200,000 feet above sea level, the system proved that it is capable of reaching air...
