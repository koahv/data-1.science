> Pulsars are highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars that emit electromagnetic radiation at regular intervals. They are often dubbed "lighthouses" of the universe as their emission is beamed; thus, the pulse of radiation is seen only each time the beam sweeps across the line of sight. A spacecraft navigation method known as XNAV, based on X-ray signals emitted from pulsars, has recently taken a leap forward, thanks to a study conducted by U.K. scientists from the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) and the University of Leicester.
