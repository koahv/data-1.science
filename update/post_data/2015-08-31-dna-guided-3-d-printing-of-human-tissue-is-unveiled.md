> (University of California - San Francisco) UCSF researchers developed a technique to build tiny models of human tissues, called organoids, more precisely than ever before using a process that turns human cells into a biological equivalent of LEGO bricks. These mini-tissues in a dish can be used to study how particular structural features of tissue affect normal growth or go awry in cancer; for therapeutic drug screening and to help teach researchers how to grow whole human organs.
