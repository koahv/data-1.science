#### Extract
>While graph databases are certainly a rising tide in the world of technology, graph theory and graph algorithms are mature and well-understood fields of computer science.

In particular, graph search algorithms can be used to mine useful patterns and results from persisted graph data. As this is a practical introduction to graph databases, this blog post will discuss the basics of graph theory without diving too deeply into mathematics....
