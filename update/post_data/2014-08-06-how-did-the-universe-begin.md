Question: How did the universe begin?
Asked by Nancy Cruz
Â 
Answer:
That&#8217;s a good question and the answer is a little unsatisfying. At the moment, we simply don&#8217;t know how the universe began. It&#8217;s important to note that a &#8220;big bang&#8221; did occur (and I stress the &#8220;a&#8221;). That much we know and are pretty comfortable about. What we don&#8217;t know is what caused the big bang, what the state of the universe was like during or right before the big bang event, and a few others. I&#8217;m going to (briefly) explain what we do know, the limitations with studying the big bang event itself, and some theories as to what caused it.
