#### Extract
>(University of the Basque Country ) Using quantum mechanics as the basis, UPV/EHU computer scientists, physicists and chemists are working together to produce simulations of the molecule in which photosynthesis occurs. They have executed an OCTOPUS software package in the fastest supercomputers in Europe, and after incorporating various improvements, they have carried out the biggest simulations made in this field by efficiently using thousands of processors....
