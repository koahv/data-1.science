>Not Made to Survive
Gene editing technologies are rapidly advancing. Tools like CRISPR-Cas9 have the potential to help us reverse and even eradicate diseases such as HIV, cancer, and so much more. However, as we genetically modify organisms, we run the risk of them mating with their non-modified counterparts, which could irreparably change wild species and disrupt whole populations and ecosystems.
“This is a problem that has been recognized for a while,&#8221; said Maciej Maselko, a postdoctoral researcher at the BioTechnology Institute and the University of Minnesota&#8217;s (U of M) College of Biological Sciences (CBS), in a U of M news release.
While previous attempts to prevent this breeding have centered on quarantining the modified or...
