> In 2012 plant scientists at Lancaster were among the first in the world to publish data explaining how plants exposed to pests or disease can pass on their immunity to their seedlings, giving them an inherited advantage which can still be seen several generations down the line. Now new research will further investigate the complex biological mechanisms behind this process, which they believe has an epigenetic basis.
