> (Science China Press) Are quantum states real? This most fundamental question in quantum mechanics has not yet been satisfactorily resolved, although its realistic interpretation seems to have been rejected by various delayed-choice experiments. Recently, scientists from University of Science and Technology of China, Harbin University of Science and Technology and other collaborators propose and demonstrate a quantum twisted double-slit experiment, in which the physical reality of wavefunctions is confirmed for the first time.
