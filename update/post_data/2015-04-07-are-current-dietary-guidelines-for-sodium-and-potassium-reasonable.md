> (University of Washington Health Sciences/UW Medicine) A recent study looked at how well people in France, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United States are meeting World Health Organization dietary goals for limiting sodium and increasing potassium intake.  The data confirm that people in all these countries eat too much sodium and not enough potassium. But they also suggest that the daily amounts proposed by WHO and other health agencies are unfeasible because the targets are so out of reach.
