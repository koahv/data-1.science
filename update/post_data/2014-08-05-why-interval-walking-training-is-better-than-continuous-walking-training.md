> Training with alternating levels of walking intensity could be better than walking at a constant speed to help manage blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes, research shows. The effects of exercise on blood sugar (glycaemic) control in individuals with type 2 diabetes are well documented but the optimal exercise intensity and type remains to be defined. Traditionally, high-intensity exercise has not been recommended for individuals with type 2 diabetes due to a fear of inducing injuries and discouraging patients from continuing with the exercise program.
