#### Extract
>The Chandra X-ray Observatory has gazed at a small patch of sky for almost 12 weeks, revealing 1,008 X-ray-emitting sources — most of them supermassive black holes.
NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory compiled this image — the deepest X-ray image ever obtained — by amassing more than 7 million seconds of observing time over a 17-year span.NASA / CXC / Penn State Univ. / B. Luo et al.
Astronomers at the winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society unveiled the "deepest" X-ray image ever made: a 7-million-second exposure of a patch of sky about two-thirds the size of the full Moon, gathered by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory during 102 pointing sessions between 1999 and 2016. Most dots in this image are supermassive black holes at the ce...
