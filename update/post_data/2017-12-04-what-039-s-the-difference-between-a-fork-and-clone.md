#### Digest
>There can be many reasons for a project fork. Perhaps the project has lain fallow for a while and someone wants to revive it. Perhaps the company that has underwritten the project has been acquired and the community is afraid that the new parent company may close the project. Or perhaps there's a schism within the community itself, where a portion of the community has decided to go a different direction with the project. 



#### Factsheet
>To "fork" means to take a copy of the project, rename it, and start a new project and community around the copy. If you wish to contribute to a project that uses git as its version control system, you'll need to create a clone of it. This will create a local clone of the repository, against which you can make whatever changes you like. If you wish to contribute the changes back to the original repository, you must send a pull request. Unless the maintainers of the original repository grant you access to it directly, you cannot contribute to that repository without both a clone of it and a pull request against it. Clones, unlike forks, are technical actions and do not need to involve the community or any social changes.
