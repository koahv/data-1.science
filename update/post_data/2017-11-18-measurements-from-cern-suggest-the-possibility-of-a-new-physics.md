>A New Quantum Physics?
During the mid- to late-twentieth century, quantum physicists picked apart the unified theory of physics that Einstein&#8217;s theory of relativity offered. The physics of the large was governed by gravity, but only quantum physics could describe observations of the small. Since then, a theoretical tug-o-war between gravity and the other three fundamental forces has continued as physicists try to extend gravity or quantum physics to subsume the other as more fundamental.
Recent measurements from the Large Hadron Collider show a discrepancy with Standard Model predictions that may hint at entirely new realms of the universe underlying what&#8217;s described by quantum physics. Although repeated tests are required to co...
