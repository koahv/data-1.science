> This week we released the latest version of HTTPS Everywhere to all of our users. Compared to the previous major release, this version introduces thousands of new rules, translations of the interface into sixteen new languages, and support for "Block All HTTP Requests" in Chrome. If you already use HTTPS Everywhere, you will automatically be updated to the latest version. If you don't have HTTPS Everywhere installed, you can get it here.HTTPS Everywhere is a browser extension that improves your privacy and security when using the web by sending you to the HTTPS-secured version of web sites listed in its rules. Ideally, every site on the web would provide HTTPS by default, and we are moving rapidly towards that ideal. But today many sites offer HTTPS only as an afterthought, and don't send their users there by default. Security-minded users can install HTTPS Everywhere to secure their connection on all of these sites.This release has some big behind-the-scenes improvements too: to handle the huge volume of ruleset contributions we've received from our active community, we've introduced new automated tests to check each ruleset for certain common errors. But even with all the new tests we've added, sometimes an HTTPS Everywhere rule will interact with a site in a way that breaks access for users of the extension. If that happens to you, disabling a rule is easy: just click on the HTTPS Everywhere icon in your browser to get a list of rules applying to the site you're visiting, and click any rule to disable it. We're very dependent on our enthusiastic user community to keep our library of rules up-to-date and working well. If you find a site that doesn't work with HTTPS Everywhere, please report a bug, either through GitHub, or by emailing https-everywhere@lists.eff.org.If you're already a happy HTTPS Everywhere user, tell a friend! Using HTTPS when browsing helps protect your data—from passwords to email content to what you read on a newspaper website—from eavesdropping and tampering, and that's privacy and security we all need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       +
