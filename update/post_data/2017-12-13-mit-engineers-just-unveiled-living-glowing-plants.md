#### Digest
>A team of MIT researchers just grew a crop of watercress that emits emit dim light for almost four hours. The plants were instilled with the same enzyme that makes fireflies sparkle. The new MIT process can work on any kind of plant; so far the scientists have demonstrated it with watercress, kale, arugula, and spinach. They hope to be able to spray or paint the nanoparticles on leaves with future iterations, so trees or large plants could serve as light sources.



#### Factsheet
>#The plants are illuminated by luciferase â€“ the same enzyme that helps fireflies shine. Luciferase acts on the molecule luciferin to give off light.
