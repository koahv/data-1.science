#### Extract
>(Goethe University Frankfurt) What happens when two black holes merge, or when stars collide with a black hole? This has now been simulated by researchers from Goethe University Frankfurt and the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies using a novel numerical method. The simulation code 'ExaHyPE' is designed in such a way that it will be able to calculate gravitational waves on the future generation of 'exascale' supercomputers....
