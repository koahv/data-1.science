#### Extract
>(Emory Health Sciences) Cas9 is part of the CRISPR genetic defense system in bacteria, which scientists have been harnessing to edit DNA in animals, plants and even human cells. Emory researchers demonstrate they can use Cas9 to put a clamp on RNA, which hepatitis C virus uses for its genetic material, rather than change cells' DNA....
