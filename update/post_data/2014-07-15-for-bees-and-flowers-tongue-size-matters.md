> (Ecological Society of America) When it comes to bee tongues, length is proportional to the size of the bee, but heritage sets the proportion. Estimating this hard to measure trait helps scientists understand bee species' resiliency to change. Ecologists will report on this and other pollination research news at the Ecological Society of America's 2014 Annual Meeting in Sacramento, Cal., August 10-15.
