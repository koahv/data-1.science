> (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center) On July 14, 2014, a sounding rocket will be ready to launch from White Sands Missile Range, N.M., a little before noon local time. The Degradation Free Spectrometers experiment will have six minutes to observe the extreme ultraviolet and soft X-rays streaming from the sun, in order to measure the sun's total energy output, known as irradiance, in these short wavelengths.
