#### Extract
>Drug-Resistant Superbugs
Antibiotic resistance is one of the main threats to public health of our time. While superbugs are emerging all over the world thanks to an overuse of existing antibiotics, particularly in agriculture and farming, new drugs able to fight increasingly potent infections are hard to come by.
To break this deadlock, researchers have been turning to synthetic molecules, which unlike common antibiotics can fight off infections without leading to drug resistance. Scientists at IBM Research, the world&#8217;s largest industrial research organization, have come up with a synthetic molecule that works as a last ditch effort against superbugs that have already spread to every organ in the body, travelling through the blood. Th...
