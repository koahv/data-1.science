#### Digest
>One reason why testing quantum gravity is so challenging is that its effects appear only at very high-energy scales and their corresponding tiny length scales. These extreme scales, which are very near the Planck scale, are roughly 15 orders of magnitude beyond those accessible by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). "We expect the geometry of spacetime to be an emergent structure, which emerges from some purely mathematical theory of quantum gravity;" Mir Faizal.
