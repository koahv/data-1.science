#### Digest
>Whales and dolphins (Cetaceans) live in tightly-knit social groups, have complex relationships, talk to each other and even have regional dialects - much like human societies. A major new study, published today in Nature Ecology & Evolution (Monday 16th October), has linked the complexity of Cetacean culture and behaviour to the size of their brains.



#### Factsheet
>The long list of behavioural similarities includes many traits shared with humans and other primates such as: complex alliance relationships - working together for mutual benefit; social transfer of hunting techniques - teaching how to hunt and using tools
