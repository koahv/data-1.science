#### Extract
>­­­LIGO has detected another black hole merger, raising the tally to five.
On November 15th, five months after the spacetime ripples jiggled LIGO’s instruments, astronomers announced the detection of their sixth gravitational-wave discovery, which is the fifth from the merger of two black holes. The event, GW170608, came from the union of the smallest black holes scientists have yet “seen” using this technique.
This graph shows the five black hole mergers discovered using gravitational waves, according to their mass in Suns. The LIGO and Virgo teams usually include a sixth potential event, LVT151012, in this graph, but because the signal's strength was too weak to qualify as a "discovery" we have removed it from this version. The teams do i...
