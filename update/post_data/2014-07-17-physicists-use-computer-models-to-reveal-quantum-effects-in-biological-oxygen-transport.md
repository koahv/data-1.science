> (Phys.org) â€”Physicists  have created a unique combination of computer models, based on the  theory of quantum mechanics, and applied them to a previously well  characterised protein found in muscle to develop a new picture of how  biomolecules transport and store oxygen (O2). In doing so,  the international team have shown how the process of respiration, which  is fundamental in humans and other vertebrates, exploits quantum  mechanical effects working on tiny scales.
