> In preparation for the imminent arrival of NASA's Juno spacecraft, astronomers have used ESO's Very Large Telescope to obtain spectacular new infrared images of Jupiter. They are part of a campaign to create high-resolution maps of the giant planet. These observations will inform the work to be undertaken by Juno over the coming months, helping astronomers to better understand the gas giant ahead of Juno's close encounter.
