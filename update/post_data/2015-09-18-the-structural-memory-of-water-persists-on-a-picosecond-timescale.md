#### Extract
>The local structural dynamics of liquid water, such as how quickly water molecules change their binding state, has now been characterized by a team of scientists. Using innovative ultrafast vibrational spectroscopies, the researchers show why liquid water is unique when compared to most other molecular liquids. ...
