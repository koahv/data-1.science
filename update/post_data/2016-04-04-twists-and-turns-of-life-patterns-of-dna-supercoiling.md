> (National Centre for Biological Sciences) Scientists from the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bangalore, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA, have elucidated genome-wide patterns in the complex structures formed by the DNA of bacteria in different environmental conditions. These complex structures in DNA could be playing important roles in regulating gene expression.
