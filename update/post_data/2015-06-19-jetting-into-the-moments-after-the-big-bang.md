> Colliding lead ions at the Large Hadron Collider creates tiny samples of matter at energy densities that have not occurred since microseconds after the Big Bang. At these densities, ordinary matter melts into its primordial constituents of quarks and gluons. To explore the properties of this plasma of quarks and gluons as it expands and cools, a new Di-Jet Calorimeter was installed at the collider.
