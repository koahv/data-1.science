> (Acoustical Society of America) Engineers at Virginia Tech have taken the first steps toward building a novel dynamic sonar system inspired by horseshoe bats that could be more efficient and take up less space than current man-made sonar arrays. They are presenting a prototype of their 'dynamic biomimetic sonar' at the 169th Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America held May 18-22, 2015 in Pittsburgh.
