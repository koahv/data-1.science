#### Extract
>Researchers at the Australian National University (ANU) have taken a major leap forward to provide practical building blocks for a global quantum internet. The team, led by Associate Professor Matthew Sellars, have shown that an erbium-doped crystal is uniquely suited to enable a global telecommunications network that harnesses the weird properties of quantum mechanics....
