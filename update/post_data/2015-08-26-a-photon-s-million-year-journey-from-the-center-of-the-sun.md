It&#8217;s a well-known fact that the light we see from stars has taken hundreds, even thousands, of years to reach us. The photons made in the centers of these distant stars have traveled across enormous expanses of space and time in order to enter our retinas. But what about the light made in our own Sun? What do those photons experience on their way to the Earth? 
Let&#8217;s chart the journey of a single photon:
First Stage: The Core

Our photon was produced in the core of the Sun: where the densities and temperatures—which can reach 15 million °C (27 million °F)—are high enough to sustain nuclear fusion. The hydrogen atoms that make up most of the Sun&#8217;s mass have too much energy...
