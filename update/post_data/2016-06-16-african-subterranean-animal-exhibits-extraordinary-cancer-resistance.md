> (Hokkaido University) Naked mole-rats (NMR) are the longest-living rodent species and exhibit extraordinary resistance to cancer. A Japanese research team found the induced pluripotent stem cells derived from NMR to be non-tumorigenic, shedding new light on their unique anti-cancer mechanism at the molecular level.
