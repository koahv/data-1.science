> (Washington State University) Washington State University Spokane scientists have grown a tiny group of brain cells that can be induced to fall asleep, wake up and even show rebound sleep after 'staying up late.' The study -- the first to document that sleep originates in small neural networks -- opens the door to deeper understanding of the genetic, molecular and electrical aspects underlying sleep disorders.
