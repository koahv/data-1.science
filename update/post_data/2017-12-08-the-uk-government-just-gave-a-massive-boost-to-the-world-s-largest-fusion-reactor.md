>Fusion Reactor
At the Culham Science Centre in Oxfordshire, two &#8220;centers of excellence&#8221; will be built. Created for the UK Atomic Energy Authority&#8217;s (UKAEA) fusion research programme at the Science Centre, many hope that this £86m government investment will help to develop fusion reactor technology for the first nuclear fusion power plants. Set to open in 2020, the centers are expected to create approximately 100 jobs and drastically push forward nuclear fusion research.
Each center will do separate things. In one, researchers will explore how to process and store tritium, which is a potential fuel source for commercial fusion reactors. In the other center, researchers will test components of prototypes under fusion reactio...
