> (VIB (the Flanders Institute for Biotechnology)) Just like other crops, trees can be genetically modified in order to introduce new, useful characteristics. Although such trees offer many socio-economic and environmental benefits, complex and unpredictable EU procedures are hindering their introduction to the market. This conclusion by researchers is part of a European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) project about genetically modified trees. RenÃ© Custers, Regulatory & Responsible Research Manager at VIB and Prof. Wout Boerjan (VIB/UGent) contributed to the text.
