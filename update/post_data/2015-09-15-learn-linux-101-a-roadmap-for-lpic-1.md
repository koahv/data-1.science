> Use this roadmap to find IBM developerWorks tutorials that help you learn and review basic Linux tasks. And if you're also pursuing professional certification as a Linux system administrator, these tutorials can help you study for the Linux Professional Institute's LPIC-1: Linux Server Professional Certification exams 101 and exam 102. This roadmap is organized according to the 43 objectives in the 101 and 102 exams, which you are required to pass for LPIC-1 certification.
