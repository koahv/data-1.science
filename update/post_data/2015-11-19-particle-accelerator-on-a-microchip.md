> (Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY) The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation has awarded $13.5 million (&euro;12.6 million) to promote the development of a particle accelerator on a microchip. DESY and the University of Hamburg are among the partners involved in this international project, headed by Robert Byer of Stanford University and Peter Hommelhoff of the University of Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg. Within five years, they hope to produce a working prototype of an 'accelerator-on-a-chip'.
