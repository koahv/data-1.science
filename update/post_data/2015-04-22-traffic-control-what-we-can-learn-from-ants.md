> Small insects self-organize the traffic on their trails to accommodate greater numbers and speeds. Rather than slowing down, ants speed up in response to a higher density of traffic on their trails, according to new research. When the researchers increased the supply of food by leaving food next to the trail, ants accelerated their speed by 50 percent. This was despite more than double the density of traffic.
