While information is available on how much wood is being harvested in Europe, it has generally not been clear where this is happening. In a recent study, a group of scientists, led by Dr. Hans Verkerk (European Forest Institute), investigated spatial patterns in wood production and, for the first time, developed high-resolution wood production maps for European forests....
