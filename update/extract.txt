455931|27-Year Study Finds the Amount of Insects Flying in the Air Has Declined 75 Percent|Roughly 80% of plants rely on insects for pollination.
453083|Learning from photosynthesis: Synthetic circuits can harvest light energy|Plants carry out photosynthesis by converting photons of light striking their chromophores into another form of energy known as an exciton. An exciton is an energetic state of a molecule, or closely coupled group of molecules after they are excited by light absorption. Quantum coherence is light excitation that can be shared between molecules which can enhance energy transfer efficiency.
452062|One step closer to crops with twice the yield|It is possible to improve photosynthesis based on natural genetic variation. This means crops could produce more yield with the same amount of soil, water and nutrients.\n Plants need light to convert CO2 and water into sugars and oxygen.
451999|New study sheds light on how earliest forms of life evolved on Earth|The earliest forms of life evolved on Earth about four billion years ago.
451640|The EPA Just Approved the Release of Mosquito-Killing Insects Grown in the Lab|Mosquitoes cause an estimated 725,000 deaths per year (November 2017)
