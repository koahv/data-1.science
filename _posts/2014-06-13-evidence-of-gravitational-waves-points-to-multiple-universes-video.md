>           Scientists have theorized that gravitational waves point to the possibility of multipe universes. Gravitational waves have infused space with a special energy that exerts a repulsive force, causing the universe to expand faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant. The ballooning process smoothed out out he wrinkles and irregularities, solving the paradox of why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole. First discovered by physicist Alan Guth in 1979, the existence of gravitational waves was confirmed by radio astronomers earlier this year who reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, confrming his hypothesis, known as inflation. Guth is currently the Victor Weisskopf Professor of Physi...
