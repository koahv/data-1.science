#### Extract
>These are very exciting times for Apache Ignite. During the past year that I have been with GridGain, I have seen some significant technology additions to the open-source project, such as support for SQL-99, Native Persistence, and Machine Learning to name but three. Earlier this year, new Genetic Algorithm (GA) code was donated to the Apache Software Foundation. Since I am not very familiar with this technology, I thought it would be a great opportunity to learn about Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and write-up a blog post.
GAs are often used to find very good solutions to complex problems by simulating biological evolution. Some example applications they could be used for include:...
