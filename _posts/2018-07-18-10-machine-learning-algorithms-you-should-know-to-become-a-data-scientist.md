#### Extract
>Machine learning practitioners have different personalities. While some of them are “I am an expert in X and X can train on any type of data,” where X = some algorithm, others are “right tool for the right job” people. A lot of them also subscribe to a “Jack of all trades, master of one” strategy, where they have one area of deep expertise and know slightly about different fields of machine&nbsp;learning. That said, no one can deny the fact that as practicing data scientists, we have to know basics of some common machine learning algorithms, which would help us engage with a new-domain problem we come across. This is a whirlwind tour of common machine learning algorithms and quick resources about them which can help you get started on them....
