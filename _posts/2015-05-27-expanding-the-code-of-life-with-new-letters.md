> The DNA encoding all life on Earth is made of four building blocks called nucleotides, commonly known as "letters," that line up in pairs and twist into a double helix. Now, two groups of scientists are reporting for the first time that two new nucleotides can do the same thingâ€”raising the possibility that entirely new proteins could be created for medical uses. Their two studies appear in ACS' Journal of the American Chemical Society.
