>Image credit: S. Willis (CfA+ISU); ESA/Herschel; NASA/JPL-Caltech/ Spitzer; CTIO/NOAO/AURA/NSF In today&#8217;s segment of FQtQ&#8217;s &#8220;APotD,&#8221; we explore a distant celestial region that is located more than 5,500 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Scorpius. This particular region, known as NGC 6334 (more casually known as the Cat&#8217;s Paw Nebula), is seen in false-color.
