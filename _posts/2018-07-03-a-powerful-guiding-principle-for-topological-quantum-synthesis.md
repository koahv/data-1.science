#### Extract
>(Science China Press) The collaborative team of Prof. Huijun Liu at Wuhan University, Prof. Xingqiu Chen at the Institute of Metal Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Prof. Zhenyu Zhang at the University of Science and Technology of China proposes an efficient criterion that allows ready screening of potential topological insulators, a powerful guiding principle in synthesizing topological quantum materials. The work has been published as a cover paper in 2017, Issue 24 of Science Bulletin....
