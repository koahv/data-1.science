#### Digest
>It is thought that anoxygenic photosynthesis evolved before oxygenic photosynthesis, playing a role in some of the earliest evidence for life on Earth, before the rise of atmospheric oxygen. Using a combination of comparative genomics and molecular clock analyses, researchers determined that phototrophic members of the Chloroflexi phylum evolved far too recently to have been the progenitors of oxygenic photosynthesis, a process that evolved about 2.3 billion years ago. In contrast, it was found that Chloroflexi did not predate the process at all, having evolved roughly 867 million years ago.

#### Extract
>Plant biologists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), in collaboration with colleagues from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), have reconstructed the evolutionary history of photosynthesis to provide new insight into the yet-unfolding story of its origins....
