#### Extract
>(California Institute of Technology) A team of physicists led by Caltech's David Hsieh has discovered an unusual form of matter -- not a conventional metal, insulator, or magnet, for example, but something entirely different. This phase, characterized by an unusual ordering of electrons, could hold the solution to a long-standing mystery in condensed matter physics having to do with high-temperature superconductivity....
