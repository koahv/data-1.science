#### Extract
>(Institute of Science and Technology Austria) A group of scientists led by Johannes Fink from the Institute of Science and Technology Austria reported the first experimental observation of a first-order phase transition in a dissipative quantum system. Phase transitions are something we often encounter in everyday life, for example when watching the freezing of water. But they also occur at the quantum mechanical level, where they are -- in spite of their importance for various fields of physics -- relatively unexplored....
