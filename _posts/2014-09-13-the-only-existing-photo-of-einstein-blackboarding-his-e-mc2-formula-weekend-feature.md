#### Extract
>&#0160; &#0160; &#0160; &#0160; At a public lecture Einstein gave in Pittsburgh in 1934, four hundred students were present when Einstein mathematically derived his famous mass-energy equivalence equation: E=mc2. This is thought to be the only surviving photo that shows Einstein working on that derivation, pulled from a halftone newspaper clipping by David Topper and Dwight Vincent of the University of Winnipeg, who discovered it in 2007. If you look closely, you’ll see the mass-energy equivalence in the lower left hand corner of the blackboard on the right. You might notice that the famous equation says Δ E0=Δ m and E0=m instead of the expected E=mc2, Topper and Vincent explain in their paper: &quot;It is the right blackboard that conta...
