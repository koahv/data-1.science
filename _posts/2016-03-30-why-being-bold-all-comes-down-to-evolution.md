#### Extract
>Chevalier Blondin was 35 years old when in 1859, with no safety harness and no net beneath him, he first tightrope-walked nearly half a kilometre across the Niagara Gorge. At different times over the coming years, he would repeat the crossing blindfolded, carrying a stove (stopping to cook himself an omelette half way), and with his manager on his back. Later on, during a visit to the UK, he crossed a tightrope while pushing a wheelbarrow with a lion in it. Chevalier Blondin was a risk taker.
