>       Researchers are sifting through an avalanche of data produced by one of the largest cosmological simulations ever performed, run on the Titan supercomputer at DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The project modeled the evolution of the universe from just 50 million years just 50 million years after the Big Bang to the present day -- from its earliest infancy to its current adulthood. Over the course of 13.8 billion years, the matter in the universe clumped together to form galaxies, stars and planets; but we're not sure precisely how. These kinds of simulations help scientists understand dark energy, a form of energy that affects the expansion rate of the universe, including the distribution of galaxies, composed of ordinary ma...
