#### Extract
>At the end of the 20th century, the universe seemed to face two possible fates: either it contained enough matter that gravity would ultimately force a re-collapse, or at the very least, its expansion would slow. But Hubble Space Telescope’s observations Typa Ia supernovae in distant galaxies turned that view upside down, showing instead that the universe’s expansion is accelerating. Cosmologists have since invoked the concept of dark energy to explain the accelerated expansion, but the <a
