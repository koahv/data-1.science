> (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research) A team of scientists led by Whitehead Institute has uncovered a surprising molecular link that connects how cells regulate growth with how they sense and make available the nutrients required for growth. The researchers' findings also implicate a new protein, SLC38A9, as a potential drug target in pancreatic cancer.
