The OSI Affiliate Member Program, available at no-cost, allows non-profit and not-for-profit organizations—unequivocally independent groups with a clear commitment to open source—to join and support our mission to promote and protect open source software and to build bridges among different constituencies in the open source community. Affiliate Members participate directly in the direction and development of the OSI through Board of Director elections as well as incubator projects and working groups that support the open source movement. OSI membership provides a forum where some of the world's most successful open source software leaders, projects, businesses and communities engage through member-driven initiatives to, not only raise awareness and adoption of open source software, but also to extend and improve their own open source efforts through co-creation, collaboration and community.
