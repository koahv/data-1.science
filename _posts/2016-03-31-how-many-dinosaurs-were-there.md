> There are more than 10,000 species of bird living on Earth today. If you recognise that birds are living dinosaurs, which overwhelming evidence indicates that they are, then this makes them more diverse than their living mammalian counterparts. So if you take the number of species to mean anything, this means we're still in the reign of the dinosaurs! These days they're just mostly a bit smaller and fluffier than their Mesozoic ancestors.
