#### Extract
>(Science China Press) Majorana fermion can serve as the building block of fault tolerant topological quantum computing. As a result, Majorana fermion drew great attention recently in the condensed matter physics. The current state research of Majorana fermion was published in a review article in Science China Physics, Mechanics & Astronomy....
