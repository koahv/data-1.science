#### Extract
>Researchers have investigated heat transport in a model system comprising nanometer-thin metallic and magnetic layers. Similar systems are candidates for future high-efficiency data storage devices that can be locally heated and rewritten by laser pulses (Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording). Measurements taken with extremely short X-ray pulses have shown that the heat is distributed a hundred times slower than expected. ...
