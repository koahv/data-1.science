#### Extract
>When the first group of American astronauts started training for space flight in the 1950s, Air Force doctors put them through a number of wrenching trials. In one, they had to endure many multiples of the force of gravity we experience at sea level — or G-force. John Glenn experienced 7.9 Gs during his first orbital flight, and others briefly went as high as 32 Gs on Houston’s infamous G Machine. “You couldn&#8217;t lift your arm out of the couch above about 6 or 7 Gs,” Glenn told a historian. “Beyond that you were just supported there.” But all of those numbers pale in comparison with a new kind of G Machine ­— GE’s computed tomography scanner called Revolution CT. Rather than preparing humans for exploring the universe, doctors use it to look inward and probe the mysteries of the body. One of its key imaging components — which weighs about 100 pounds — routinely reaches 70 Gs as it circles around patients lying inside the machine’s gantry up to five times per second. The machine is...
