#### Extract
>Credit CybherHades via Flickr CC When scientists develop a full quantum computer, the world of computing will undergo a revolution of sophistication, speed and energy efficiency that will make even our beefiest conventional machines seem like Stone Age clunkers by comparison. But, before that happens, quantum physicists like the ones in UC Santa Barbara&#8217;s physics professor John Martinis&#8217; lab will have to create circuitry that takes advantage of the marvelous computing prowess promised by the quantum bit (&#8220;qubit&#8221;), while compensating for its high vulnerability to environmentally-induced error. In what they are calling a major milestone, the researchers in the Martinis Lab have developed quantum circuitry that self-checks for errors and suppresses them, preserving the qubits&#8217; state(s) and imbuing the system with the highly sought-after reliability that will prove foundational for the building of large-scale superconducting quantum computers. It turns out kee...
