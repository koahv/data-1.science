#### Extract
>We finally know the ingredients that fire up a particular kind of supernova. Four researchers explain why a better understanding of how certain stars die can help reveal the evolution of the cosmos and its galaxies. This simulated image depicts the explosive death of a white dwarf as a Type Ia supernova with a stellar companion. When the supernova explodes (dark brown), its ejected material slams into the companion star (light blue). The violent collision produces an ultraviolet pulse, which is emitted from the conical hole carved out by the companion star. Daniel Kasen A longstanding mystery about the tiny stars that let loose powerful explosions known as Type Ia supernovae might finally be solved. For brief periods, these cataclysmic blas...
