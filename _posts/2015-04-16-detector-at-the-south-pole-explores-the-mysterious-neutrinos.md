#### Extract
>Neutrinos are a type of particle that pass through just about everything in their path from even the most distant regions of the universe. The giant IceCube experiment at the South Pole can detect when there is a collision between neutrinos and atoms in the ice using detectors. New research results from the Niels Bohr Institute have measured the neutrinos and calculated some of the physical properties of the otherwise exotic and poorly understood particles....
