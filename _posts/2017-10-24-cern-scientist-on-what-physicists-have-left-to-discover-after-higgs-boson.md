>A Tiny, Huge Discovery
On July 4th, 2012, researchers from the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) made a big announcement. They had observed the Higgs boson, an elementary particle predicted by one of the best models for physics in the universe. &#8220;&#8216;We discovered the particle that makes it possible for atoms to form in the first place.’ That’s much sexier,” James Beacham, a particle physicist at CERN, said of the discovery in an interview at Brain Bar Budapest, a future-oriented science festival in Hungary held in June.
Those in the know might have been anticipating this observation for decades, but that didn&#8217;t dampen the excitement. The discovery marked the culmination of a 40-year scientific effort, as Beach...
