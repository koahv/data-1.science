One of the underlying principles of quantum theory is that quantum objects can exist as waves or particles. But, they do not exist as either until they are measured, making it seemingly unachievable to identify or track quantum objects when they&#8217;re not being observed. But recently, physicists faced this issue and proved that it is not an impossibility to track unobserved quantum particles.
David Arvidsson-Shukur, the study&#8217;s first author and a Ph.D. student at Cambridge&#8217;s Cavendish Laboratory, became interested in a physics premise called &#8220;the wave function.&#8221; While it seemed to contain a wealth of information, it had been used more as a mathematical tool than a representation of actual quantum ...
