#### Extract
>(American Institute of Physics) Quantum dots are rapidly taking center stage in emerging applications and research developments, but researchers are still studying how to precisely control the growth of these nanoscale particles and their underlying quantum behavior. For instance, defects form during production of semiconductor materials, so identical dots can differ in composition from one another. To learn more about these defects, a team has demonstrated imaging of an electronically excited quantum dot at multiple orientations....
