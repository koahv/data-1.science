#### Extract
>Wormholes, alternate universes, time warps — we’ve all heard crazy theories about what happens inside a black hole. So what’s the real story? Artist's illustration of the silhouette of a black hole surrounded by stars. NASA GSFC The short answer is, physicists don’t know. A somewhat longer answer is, it depends on whom you ask. What's inside a black hole? We basically understand what happens outside the black hole as you approach its event horizon, that infamous point of no return. The event horizon is where the escape speed exceeds the speed of light: you’d have to be going faster than light (which is impossible for any bit of matter) to escape the black hole’s gravity. Inside the event horizon is where physics goes crazy. Calculations su...
