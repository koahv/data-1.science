> (National Science Foundation) What if a map of the brain could help us decode people's inner thoughts?Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, have taken a step in that direction by building a 'semantic atlas' that shows in vivid colors and multiple dimensions how the human brain organizes language. The atlas identifies brain areas that respond to words that have similar meanings.
