#### Extract
>Glowing plants might sound like the stuff of science fiction &#8211; but a team of MIT researchers just grew a crop of watercress that emits emit dim light for almost four hours. Postdoctoral researcher Seon-Yeong Kwak led a team of engineers and scientists to instill the plants with the same enzyme that makes fireflies sparkle. MIT chemical engineering professor Michael Strano said, &#8220;The vision is to make a plant that will function as a desk lamp &#8211; a lamp that you don&#8217;t have to plug in.
