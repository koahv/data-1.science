#### Extract
>
Today is already a good day, you can now add CRYENGINE to the official list of game engines that support Linux, so here's to hoping more games can come over.

This means games like Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Evolve, Crysis (I can dream!) and many more can easily come over to Linux. It's still probably not a click of a button, but it means developers have far less work to do.

QuoteNew API: OpenGL Support
Starting with 3.8.1, we are shipping a fully-featured OpenGL rendering implementation with CRYENGINE, which goes hand in hand with Linux support for your games (see below).

New platform: Linux
As previously announced, we are adding Linux support for your Game.exe. While you will still need Windows to use the Sandbox Editor, you can now release your commercial games on Linux as well as on PC- and of course, there are still no royalties whatsoever! 

See their full announcement here.

It's doubtful we will see any older games coming over, that is unless developers really care about their older games. It's a shame, as we do need a back catalogue of older games, and not just newer games. If Crytek ported their Crysis games over to Linux, that would be a great showcase for their engine, but I extremely doubt they would.
