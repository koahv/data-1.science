#### Extract
>The open source map project published in Nature this week shows us that neutrinos and antineutrinos are everywhere around us, and don’t just come from sun rays and nuclear reactors, but can be detected within the Earth, its atmosphere and, of course, across the cosmos. The neutrino was theorised by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930 to explain the continuous energy spectrum of nuclear beta rays. Further research by Enrico Fermi around the time of the Manhattan Project in the 1940s produced a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction caused by antineutrinos, antimatter cousins to neutrinos and the smallest particles known to science. The scientists conclude that the level of interactions between these particles means that the Earth is pretty much a “neutri...
