#### Extract
>&#8220;Presence is far more intricate and rewarding an art than productivity.&#8221;
In the fall of 2013, as Brain Pickings was turning seven, I wrote about the seven most important things I learned in those seven years of reading, writing, and living. Much to my surprise and humbling delight, I began receiving a steady outpour of letters from readers, people for whom these notes to myself had struck a deep chord of resonance in their own lives, on their own journeys.
Eventually, my friends at Holstee &#8212; makers of the beloved Holstee Manifesto &#8212; reached out and suggested a creative collaboration that would bring these seven learnings to life in visual form. Having known the Holstee crew for many years, and having long shared an enormous kinship of spirit and values with them, I was instantly in. We worked with Uruguayan illustrator and graphic designer Martin Azambuja, who came up with the visual metaphor of a mobile for an added layer of symbolism.
I&#8217;m proud and so very excited to reveal the end result of this collaborative labor of love, months in the making &#8212; an 18&#8243;x24&#8243; letterpress poster printed on thick, sustainable cotton paper, inspired by vintage children&#8217;s book illustration and mid-century graphic design.
