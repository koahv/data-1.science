#### Extract
>University of Groningen scientists have obtained the first precise estimates of how often epigenetic marks that influence gene activity appear or disappear in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism in plant biology. This paves the way to a deeper understanding of the importance of epigenetic changes in plant evolution. The work is published in the week of 11 May in the online Early Edition of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences....
