> Without advanced sensing technology, humans see only a small portion of the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Satellites see the full rangeâ€”from high-energy gamma rays, to visible, infrared, and low-energy microwaves. The images and data they collect can be used to solve complex problems. For example, satellite data is being harnessed by researchers at the University of Illinois for a more complete picture of cropland and to estimate crop yield in the U.S. Corn Belt.
