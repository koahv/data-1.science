#### Extract
>Cassini's final main engine burn this weekend sets the stage for a stunning grand finale. An artist's conception of NASA's Cassini spacecraft on its final ring-grazing orbits.NASA / JPL / Cassini After more than a decade exploring the ringed planet and its moons, NASA's Cassini spacecraft is preparing for a daring set of orbits which will set it up for mission's end later next year. The recent 125th flyby of Saturn's giant moon Titan (T-125) was the prelude to Cassini's final acts, which will play out over the next year. That pass placed Cassini in a high-inclination orbit tilted 60° relative to the ring plane. Cassini will perform 20 passes just 620 miles (1000 kilometers) outside the F ring of Saturn in a phase known as the Ring-Grazing Orbits, which runs from late November 2016 through April 2017. Extended mission solstice orbits (blue) versus the upcoming ring grazing orbits (tan). NASA / JPL / Cassini Cassini already reached apoapse, or its farthest point from Saturn, on Wednesday...
