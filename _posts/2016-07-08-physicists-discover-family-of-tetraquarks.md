> (Syracuse University) Physicists in the College of Arts and Sciences have made science history by confirming the existence of a rare four-quark particle and discovering evidence of three other 'exotic' siblings.   Their findings are based on data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world's biggest, most powerful particle accelerator, located at the CERN science laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland.
