#### Extract
>
NASA just launched a new high-resolution computer model that gives a stunning look at the yearly movement of carbon emissions through the planetâ€™s atmosphere. NASA created the model by combining ground-based measurements with data received from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) which was launched in July. The simulation is one of the highest resolution models ever created, and it clearly shows major emission sources and the way winds disperse greenhouse gases.
