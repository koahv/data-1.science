>A team of tissue engineers has shown that a rat's liver can remain viable for four days outside of the body, using a new "supercooling" technique. Cooling donor organs in ice and a special solution can help ensure they last long enough to transport them to a recipient. However, those timings vary hugely and put constraints on medical teams to rush the procedure while it remains in a very narrow window of viability. For instance, while kidneys can last around 24 hours, hearts and lungs have a survival time outside the body of around five hours. A team from the Centre for Engineering in Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital opted to trial a new preservation technique with livers, which tend to last around 12 hours after extraction. Of...
