#### Extract
>Three American physicists have received the Nobel Prize in physics for their contributions to the discovery of gravitational waves. Ranier Weiss (MIT), Kip S. Thorne (Caltech), and Barry C. Barish (Caltech) have been chosen by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for the award thanks to their decisive contributions in the development of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and their observations of gravitational waves. LIGO This could have been an exciting day for Albert Einstein â€” were he alive, of course. The Nobel Prize in physics for 2017 has been awarded to three researchers for their work helping to prove a prediction he made more than 100 years ago, based on his general theory of relativity: the existence o...
