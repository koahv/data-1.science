#### Extract
>(University of Sydney) Simulation of chemical bonds and reactions is expected to be one of the first applications for at-scale quantum computers. Here a University of Sydney physicist, Dr Cornelius Hempel, demonstrates the world-first simulation of a chemical bond using trapped ion qubits, one of the most promising pathways to full-scale quantum computing....
