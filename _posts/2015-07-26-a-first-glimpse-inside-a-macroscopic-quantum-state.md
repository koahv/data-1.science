#### Extract
>(ICFO-The Institute of Photonic Sciences) Science News reports on detection of particle entanglement in a beam of squeezed light. ICFO researchers were able to observe effects of entanglement monogamy, where particles can be strongly entangled only if they have few entanglement partners....
