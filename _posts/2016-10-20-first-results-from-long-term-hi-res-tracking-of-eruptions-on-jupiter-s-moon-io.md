> (University of California - Berkeley) UC Berkeley astronomers who have been tracking volcanic activity on Io at high frequency since 2013 using adaptive optics on the Keck and Gemini telescopes published their first 29 months of observations. The 100 separate images over that period show more than 400 hot spot events, ranging from eruptions to lava flows old and new. Some of the eruptions appeared to progress across the surface over time, as if one triggered another 500 kilometers away.
