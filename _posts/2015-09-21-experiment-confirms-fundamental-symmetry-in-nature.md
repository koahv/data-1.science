#### Extract
>(Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo) Scientists working with ALICE, a heavy-ion detector on the Large Hadron Collider ring, have made precise measurements of particle mass and electric charge that confirm the existence of a fundamental symmetry in nature. The findings, reported in a paper published online in Nature Physics on Aug. 17, led the researchers to confirm a fundamental symmetry between the nuclei of the particles and their antiparticles in terms of charge, parity and time.
