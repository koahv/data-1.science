> Recently, on Twitter and Facebook I noticed graphs of climate change and its impacts being posted.  These were often unaccompanied with data sources or links. A lot of misinformation occurs across the web in both denial and support of climate change. Beyond a shadow of doubt, anthropogenically caused climate change is occurring.  However, we do the public no favors by posting graphs with uncited sources and complete transparency about sources and data. Below I provide 15 graphs of climate change providing their sources.  Overwhelming they portray an alarming picture of changes on our planet.  I chose only graphs that depict current or past changes.  I specifically excluded projections and focused on patterns where the climate change link is not speculative.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               +
