> Because the Linux kernel community celebrated a quarter-century of development in 2016, many people have asked us the secret to the project's longevity and success. I usually laugh and joke that we really have no idea how we got here. The project has faced many disagreements and challenges along the way. But seriously, the reason we've made it this far has a lot to do with the community's capacity for introspection and change.
