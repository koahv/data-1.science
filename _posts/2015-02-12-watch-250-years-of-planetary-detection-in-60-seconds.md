It&#8217;s so large that we may sometimes feel as though we are lost in a vast, empty sea. But of course, the cosmos is anything but empty. The universe is populated with asteroids, planets, stars, black holes, and a plethora of other objects. This seems rather obvious; however, we didn&#8217;t always know this.

At this point, Dr. Alexander Wolszczan, a radio astronomer at Pennsylvania State University, reported what he called &#8220;unambiguous proof&#8221; of extrasolar planetary systems (of course, scientists believed that other planets existed before this, but believe and proof are terribly different). Notably, the first dete...
