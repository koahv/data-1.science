>&nbsp; In May of 2015, an international team of astronomers led by Yale University and the University of California-Santa Cruz observed a primordial galaxy that pushes back the cosmic frontier of galaxy exploration to a time when the universe was only 5% of its present age. We can only imagine what this primorial galaxy looks like today. The new distance measurement also enabled the astronomers to determine that EGS-zs8-1 is still forming stars rapidly, about 80 times faster than our Milky Way galaxy. Astronomers have mapped and measured the cosmos as far as the laws of physics allow to the very edge of the observable universe. Age and distance are vitally connected in any discussion of the universe. The light we see from our Sun takes j...
