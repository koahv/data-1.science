#### Extract
>Researchers have shown that changing just a single letter of the DNA of human red blood cells in the laboratory increases their production of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin -- a world-first advance that could lead to a cure for sickle cell anemia and other blood disorders. The new genome editing technique introduces a beneficial, naturally occurring genetic mutation into the cells to switch on a gene that is turned off in most people after birth....
