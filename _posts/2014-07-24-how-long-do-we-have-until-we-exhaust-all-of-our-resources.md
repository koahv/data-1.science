>Question: With the current human population, and its rate of expansion, together with the rate of consumption of natural resources, how long until the human race reaches a point of no return, and we simply have nothing left?

Answer: The act of simply existing requires three main ingredients; Water, oxygen, and energy. In a perfect world, we would have a period equivalent to the Sun&#8217;s life to live, which is about 10 billion years in total. However, there are so many external factors: things that could go wrong, ways in which the universe can kill us, or even ways in which we can kill ourselves. Things like asteroid collisions with earth, a nuclear war, or even an ice age can get the job done quite easily.
Although innovations such as nuclear fusion or the colonization of Mars can give us more time, the second law of thermodynamics states that every time a change in energy occurs, the universe becomes more disordered, unorganized, and chaotic. This means that as you use up energy to read this answer, somewhere else in the universe is becoming more unstable. Every time you move a muscle, you are hastening the universe towards disorder. Furthermore, the universe is rapidly expanding, so there will inevitably be a time where the night sky is completely dark as there are no visible stars close to us, and the temperature is so cold that life cannot possibly exist.
As for the finite amount of natural resources on Earth, there are first four realizations one must take into consideration: 
1) We cannot continue to think we have an unlimited amount of natural resources.
2) We will not be able find a technological fix that will allow us to consume unlimited resources
3)  The term &#8220;renewable&#8221; resource does not imply that it is unlimited.
4) When we use a natural resource, we may turn it into something useless through entropy (For example, if we burn wood for heat, it turns to ashes which are useless to us). The natural resources are diminishing while our population is exponentially increasing. We cannot assure future generations of an adequate supply of clean air, safe water, or a healthy food supply.
The truth is, it is very hard to predict when we will completely run out of usable resources given the large number of things that need to be taken into account — things like natural disasters (and the like), how much the population will grow in the coming decades and how the economy will turn — along with a few things we can&#8217;t anticipate. 
The Estimate:
You wouldn&#8217;t be here if you didn&#8217;t want a decent estimate, so I&#8217;ll give you one. The most recent data, which was released earlier this year, suggests that the world might be heading toward an &#8220;irreversible collapse&#8221; as a result of unsustainable resource exploitation and &#8220;increasingly unequal wealth distribution.&#8221; When will the switch flip? Well, they assert that it&#8217;ll happen within a few decades.
Don&#8217;t read too much into it though, as the report also states that &#8220;the process of rise-and-collapse is actually a recurrent cycle found throughout history.&#8221;
My hypothesis is that if something happened and we lost access to water, food, or clean air right this instant, the population would dramatically decrease in merely a decade or two, with only the wealthiest people having access to an above standard quality of life. 
When this happens, obviously resources would be consumed at a slower rate. We can only hope in such an instance, people would be conscience of how and what they consume, but given the current state of affairs, it seems unlikely. People are nothing if not stuck in their own ways. What are your thoughts?
