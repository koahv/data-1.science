#### Extract
>(University of Toronto) What used to be dismissed by many as 'junk DNA' is back with a vengeance as growing data points to the importance of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) -- genome's messages that do not code for proteins --  in development and disease. Professor Benjamin Blencowe's team at the University of Toronto's Donnelly Centre have developed a method that enables scientists to explore in depth what ncRNAs do in human cells....
