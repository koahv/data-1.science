#### Digest
>Since the dawn of electronics design, where there have been designs, there have been bugs. But where they have been bugs, there inevitably was debug, engaged in an epic wrestling match with faults, bugs, and errors to determine which would prevail -- and how thoroughly. Today, after 40 years of innovation, we're on the cusp of a new era in debug, one in which engineers can perform debug and trace over functional I/O, thereby saving both time and money. The push for performing debug over existing device interfaces will not only provide a leaner solution, but will also help step up debug and trace capability to the next level. Thus begins a new chapter in our fascinating and long history in the war against bugs.



#### Factsheet
>Debug has evolved from simple stimulus-response-observe approaches to sophisticated tools, equipment, and methodologies conceived to address increasingly complex designs.
