#### Extract
>(DOE/Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory) Scientists led by Stephen Jardin, principal research physicist and head of the Computational Plasma Physics Group at the US Department of Energy's (DOE) Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), have won 40 million core hours of supercomputer time to simulate plasma disruptions that can halt fusion reactions and damage fusion facilities, so that scientists can learn how to stop them. The PPPL team will apply its findings to ITER, the international tokamak under construction in France to demonstrate the practicality of fusion energy....
