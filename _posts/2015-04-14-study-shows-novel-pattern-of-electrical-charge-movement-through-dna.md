#### Extract
>(Arizona State University) Research reveals a new mechanism of charge transport in DNA that differs from the two recognized patterns in which charge either tunnels or hops along bases of the DNA chain.Researchers predict that foundational work of this kind will have important implications in the design of a new generation of functional DNA-based electronic devices as well as providing new insights into health risks associated with transport-related damage to DNA....
