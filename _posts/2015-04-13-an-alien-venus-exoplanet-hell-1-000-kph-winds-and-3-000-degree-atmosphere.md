Now, it looks like Venus (NASA image above) has some company beyond our solar system. As part of the PlanetS National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR), astronomers from the Universities of Geneva (UNIGE) and Bern, Switzerland, have come to measure the temperature of the atmosphere of an exoplanet with unequaled precision, by crossing two approaches. The first approach is based on the HARPS spectrometer and the second consists of a new way of interpreting s...
