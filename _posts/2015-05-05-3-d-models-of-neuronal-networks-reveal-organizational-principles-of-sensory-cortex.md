#### Extract
>Researchers have succeeded in reconstructing the neuronal networks that interconnect the elementary units of sensory cortex -- cortical columns. The scientists say that this study marks a major step forward to advance the understanding of the organizational principles of the neocortex and sets the stage for future studies that will provide extraordinary insight into how sensory information is represented, processed and encoded within the cortical circuitry....
