> (Gemini Observatory) During the middle of 2013, Jupiter's moon Io came alive with volcanism. Now, an image from the Gemini Observatory captures what is one of the brightest volcanoes ever seen in our solar system. The image, obtained on Aug. 29, reveals the magnitude of the eruption that was the 'grand finale' in a series of eruptions on the distant moon.
