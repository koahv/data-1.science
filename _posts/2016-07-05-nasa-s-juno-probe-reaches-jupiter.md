>After a 5-year-long journey, NASA's Juno probe, an emissary to the largest planet in the solar system, has arrived at its destination and slipped into orbit around Jupiter. An artist's conception of Juno performing a 35-minute-long engine firing to enter orbit around Jupiter.NASA / JPL "Joy" at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's mission control center today is spelled JOI — for Jupiter Orbital Insertion. July 4th fireworks erupted in the outer solar system overnight, as the Juno probe fired its main engine and entered a polar orbit around Jupiter at 11:53 p.m. EDT (Earth receive time), which was 3:53 Universal Time (UT) on July 5th. Juno carried out a scheduled 35-minute-long burn that slowed its velocity by 542 meters per second (1,212 mph), enough to become a captured satellite of Jupiter with an initial 53.5-day orbital period.
