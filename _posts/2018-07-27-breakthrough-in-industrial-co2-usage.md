#### Extract
>(Technical University of Munich (TUM)) Professor Arne Skerra of the Technical University of Munich has succeeded for the first time in using gaseous CO2 as a basic material for the production of a chemical mass product in a biotechnical reaction. The product is methionine, which is used as an essential amino acid, particularly in animal feed, on a large scale. This newly developed enzymatic process could replace its current petrochemical production. The results have been published in Nature Catalysis....
