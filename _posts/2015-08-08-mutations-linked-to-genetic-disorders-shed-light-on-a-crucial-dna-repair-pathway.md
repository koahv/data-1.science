#### Extract
>Researchers have identified two new genes in which mutations can interfere with a cell's ability to remove misplaced links between DNA strands, and, as a result, cause a rare genetic disorder known as Fanconi anemia. These discoveries offer new insight on a repair process critical to maintaining certain tissues and preventing cancer....
