#### Extract
>I recently came across a wiki page written by Herman Brule which gives a quick benchmark on a couple of compression methods / algorithms. It gave me the idea of writing a quick script that tests out a wide number of compression utilities available in Gentoo (usually through the app-arch category), with also a number of options (in case multiple options are possible). The currently supported packages are: app-arch/bloscpack app-arch/bzip2 app-arch/freeze app-arch/gzip app-arch/lha app-arch/lrzip app-arch/lz4 app-arch/lzip app-arch/lzma app-arch/lzop app-arch/mscompress app-arch/p7zip app-arch/pigz app-arch/pixz app-arch/plzip app-arch/pxz app-arch/rar app-arch/rzip app-arch/xar app-arch/xz-utils app-arch/zopfli app-arch/zpaq The script should keep the best compression information: duration, compression ratio, compression command, as well as the compressed...
