#### Extract
>
      Python language developer Nick Coghlan has posted <a
href="http://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2015/10/languages-to-improve-your-python.html">a
survey of 27 languages that, he thinks, have lessons for Python.
"One of the things we do as part of the Python core development
process is to look at features we appreciate having available in other
languages we have experience with, and see whether or not there is a way to
adapt them to be useful in making Python code easier to both read and
write. This means that learning another programming language that focuses
more specifically on a given style of software development can help improve
anyone's understanding of that style of programming in the context of
Python."
