#### Extract
>New results from NASA's Dawn orbiter show that the largest asteroid (and acknowledged dwarf planet) must possess a global layer of water ice that lies just below its dark, dusty surface. Even before NASA's Dawn spacecraft reached asteroid 1 Ceres in March 2015, planetary scientists knew that this sizable world was not the dry-as-dust object that comes to mind when we imagine what asteroids should be like. For starters, it has a density (2.1 g/cm3) far too low for a solid ball of silicate rock. Infrared spectra taken as long ago as 1978 revealed the presence of water-infused clay minerals on its surface, and scans by ESA's Herschel space observatory a few years ago even caught Ceres exhaling clouds of water vapor. A comparison of hydrogen's abundance near the surfaces of asteroids Vesta and Ceres. The vlues for Ceres, at least 100 times higher, imply that the hydrogen is bound into water â€” either in hydrated (clay) minerals or as water ice.NASA / JPL / UCLA / MPS / DLR / IDA / PSI But o...
