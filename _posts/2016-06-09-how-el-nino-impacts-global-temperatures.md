> (Australian National University) Scientists have found past El Niño oscillations in the Pacific Ocean may have amplified global climate fluctuations for hundreds of years at a time.The team uncovered century-scale patterns in Pacific rainfall and temperature, and linked them with global climate changes in the past 2,000 years, which will influence climate models of current trends.
