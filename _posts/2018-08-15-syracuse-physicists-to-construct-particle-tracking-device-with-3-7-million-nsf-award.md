#### Extract
>(Syracuse University) Physicists at Syracuse University are closer to understanding what happened after the Big Bang nearly 14 billion years ago, thanks to a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The grant will support ongoing physics data analysis at the Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHcb) experiment at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland, as well as the construction and testing of a new tracking device called the Upstream Tracker (UT), located in the experiment's particle detector....
