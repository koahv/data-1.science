#### Extract
>(University of MÃ¼nster) The board game Go was long considered to be a bastion reserved for human players due to its complexity. Nowadays, however, the world's best players no longer have any chance of winning against the 'AlphaGo' software. Researchers at the University of Muenster have now demonstrated that the recipe for the success of this software can be put to excellent use to plan chemical syntheses. The study has been published in the current issue of the Nature journal....
