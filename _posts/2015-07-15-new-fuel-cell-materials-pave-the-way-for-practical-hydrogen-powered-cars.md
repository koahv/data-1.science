#### Extract
>Hydrogen fuel cells promise clean cars that emit only water. Several major car manufacturers have recently announced their investment to increase the availability of fueling stations, while others are rolling out new models and prototypes. However, challenges remain, including the chemistry to produce and use hydrogen and oxygen gas efficiently.

Today, in ACS Central Science, two research teams report advances on chemical reactions essential to fuel-cell technology in separate papers.Read more about New Fuel-Cell Materials Pave the Way for Practical Hydrogen-Powered Cars Comments
