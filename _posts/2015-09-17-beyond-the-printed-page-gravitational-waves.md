#### Extract
>Predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity, gravitational waves are essentially ripples in the fabric of spacetime, created by accelerating masses. You can think of them like the ripples created when an oar moves through the surface of a lake. Kind of. As part of our December 2015 issue’s articles on general relativity and gravitational waves, we’ve compiled some videos to help you grasp both gravity and its waves. First, what does gravitational radiation do to spacetime? Animations for Physics and Astronomy has put together schematics to show what a linearly polarized gravitational wave does to this fabric. The dots tracing out circles represent points in spacetime; the circles' deformation shows how those points in spacetime cha...
