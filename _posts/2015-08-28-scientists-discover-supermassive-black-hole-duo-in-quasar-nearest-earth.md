>NASA&#8217;s Hubble Space Telescope was used to find two supermassive black holes in Markarian 231. (Credit: Space Telescope Science Institute) In a staggering find, scientists recently announced that the quasar closest to Earth is powered by two, not one, supermassive black holes. The quasar in question lives in a galaxy dubbed Markarian 231 (Mrk 231). And although Mrk231 is the closest galaxy to Earth that hosts a known quasar, it is still rather far away, orbiting through the cosmos some 600 million light-years from our solar system. Quasars, or “quasi-stellar radio sources” are the brightest and most distant star-like objects in the known universe. In fact, they are so bright, and they emit so much energy, some of them are believed to b...
