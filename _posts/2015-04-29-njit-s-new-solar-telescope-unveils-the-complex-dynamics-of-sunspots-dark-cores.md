#### Extract
>(New Jersey Institute of Technology) Groundbreaking images of the sun captured by scientists at NJIT's Big Bear Solar Observatory give a first-ever detailed view of the interior structure of umbrae -- the dark patches in the center of sunspots -- revealing dynamic magnetic fields responsible for the plumes of plasma that emerge as bright dots interrupting their darkness.
