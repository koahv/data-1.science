> The naming of colors has long been a topic of interest in the study of human culture and cognition -- revealing the link between perception, language, and the categorization of the natural world. A major question in the study of both anthropology and cognitive science is why the world's languages show recurrent similarities in color naming. Linguists tracked the evolution of color terms across a large language tree in Australia in order to trace the history of these systems.
