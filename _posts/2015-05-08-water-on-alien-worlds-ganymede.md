This approach was recently used to show that Jupiter’s moon Ganymede has more liquid water than Earth. You might have seen an aurora on Earth when there has been a rise in solar activity. On Earth, the aurora (or northern lights) are caused by charged particles emitted by solar flares that interact with Earth’s magnetic field.

The charges gener...
