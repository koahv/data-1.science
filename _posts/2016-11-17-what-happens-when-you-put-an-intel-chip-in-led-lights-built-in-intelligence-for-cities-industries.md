#### Extract
>The shift to using more efficient lights inspired GE and Intel to create smart LEDs that can see, hear and sense their surroundings, creating data that can improve efficiency and empower smart city services. &nbsp; &nbsp; Since American inventor Thomas Edison patented the first commercially successful bulb in 1879, the population of light fixtures has exploded. Today, an estimated 2.5 billion light bulbs are sold each year. Despite being a modern life necessity and symbol of illuminating ideas, many think light bulbs do little more than turn on, off or dim.  Instead, innovation in lighting is quickening. LED — Light Emitting Diode — bulbs, for example use a solid state semiconductor chip that glows when electrical current runs through it. They’re bright, use up to 80 percent less energy and can last fifteen times longer than incandescent bulbs, according to GE. Now engineers are making smart LED lights with sensors, computing and communication capabilities. Light bulbs are destined to ...
