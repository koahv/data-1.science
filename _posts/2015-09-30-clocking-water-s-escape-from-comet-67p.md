#### Extract
>Thanks to the Rosetta spacecraft, researchers can follow the cycle of water escaping from the nucleus of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, as it appeared in September 2014. Scientists have intensively studied Hapi, the bright region in the boxed area, for evidence of water ice and escaping vapor.ESA / Rosetta team The bizarrely shaped periodic comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko reached perihelion on August 13th, coming just 1.24 astronomical units (186 million km) from the Sun. All the while European Space Agency scientists have used the Rosetta spacecraft to provide a fascinating look at what happens on the surface of a comet during its most active phase — and to peek into what's going on down below as well. Since reaching Comet 67P in August 2014, Rosetta has documented the comet's evolving activity and the outgassing of volatiles such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. But the source and cycling of its water has remained a major mystery. The comet's...
