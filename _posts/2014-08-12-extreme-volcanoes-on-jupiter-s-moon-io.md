style="color: #5274ae;">Even on Io, a world known for spouting off, the titanic volcanic eruption seen on August 29, 2013, was among the most powerful ever recorded there — or anywhere else in the solar system.This time last year, a trio of volcanoes erupted so violently and powerfully that they would have been "breaking news" had they occurred anywhere on Earth. Fortunately, the towering fountains of fire were more than a half billion miles away, on Jupiter's moon Io.<div

Due to Io’s rapid rotation, each night shows a different area of the surface. The outburst waned in brightness on August 30th and September 1st, 3rd, and 10th.<br
/>Katherine de Kleer / UC Berkeley / Gemini Observatory / AURAImke de Pater (University of California, Berkeley) discovered the first two outbursts on August 15, 2013, using one of the 10-meter telescopes at Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The brighter one, at a previously known eruption site named Rarog Patera, was calculated to have covered 50 square miles with a lava flow 30 feet thick. The other, at Heno Patera, spewed molten rock over roughly 120 square miles. Both had abated by the time de Pater checked again five days later.But the real fireworks were yet to come. A third, even brighter eruption flared to life on August 29th and was captured simultaneously with the nearby Gemini North telescope and NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility on Mauna Kea. The outburst was so intense and hot — even by Io's standards — that it probably involved a cluster of towering lava fountains spread over an estimated 32 square miles. The eruption's location, within a few degrees of 223° west, 29° north, is not associated with any <a

class="wp-caption-text">The Jovian moon Io is a dynamic world where volcanoes erupt continuously, staining the surface with red and yellow allotropes of sulfur. Taken by the Galileo spacecraft in December 2000, these images reveal a fresh red ring (left), some 1,000 miles (1,500 km) across, encircling the volcano called Pele.<br
/>NASA / JPLThe Voyager 1 spacecraft first discovered volcanoes on Io during its 1979 flyby. Since then observations with spacecraft and ground-based telescopes have shown that this moon erupts nearly constantly, making it the most volcanic body in the solar system. About 150 sites are active now, and the total count is roughly 400. Researchers believe Io's eruptions mimic the kinds of volcanic activity that shaped the inner planets, including Earth, in the early solar system.For details about last year's trio of powerful eruptions, see the press releases from <a
