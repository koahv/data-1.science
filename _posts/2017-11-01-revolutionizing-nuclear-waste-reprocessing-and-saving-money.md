#### Extract
>Seeking a better way to capture radioactive iodides in spent nuclear reactor fuel, scientists have developed an extremely efficient 'molecular trap' that can be recycled and reused....

#### Factsheet
>Reprocessing means separating spent nuclear reactor fuel into materials that may be recycled for use in new nuclear fuel or discarded as waste, according to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 

When spent fuel is reprocessed, radioactive molecular iodine and organic iodide gases that pose cancer and environmental risks must be captured and sequestered.
