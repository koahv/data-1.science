#### Extract
>       An international team of physicists has published ground-breaking research on the decay of subatomic particles called kaons – which could change how scientists understand the formation of the universe. Nicolas Garron, a Research Fellow in the Centre of Mathematical Sciences, has helped to devise the first theoretical calculation of how the behaviour of kaons differs when matter – anything with mass, such as the world around us – is swapped out for antimatter – made out of similar particles with opposite charge. The calculation of the kaon decays was conducted on supercomputers, which would have taken 200 million core processing hours on a laptop. The rate at which the kaons decay highlights that, despite being virtually identic...
