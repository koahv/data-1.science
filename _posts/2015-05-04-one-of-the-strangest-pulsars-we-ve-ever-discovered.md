#### Extract
>Black holes are some of the most powerful and perplexing objects in the known universe. They are infinitely dense objects that warp spacetime so much, nothing (not even light itself) can escape their grasp. But of course, black holes aren&#8217;t the only strange objects that we know of. If there&#8217;s anything  that can rival the power and quantum craziness of black holes, it&#8217;s pulsars.
Pulsars are a kind of star. Specifically, they are neutron stars that are rotating at amazing speeds and pointing right at us. Many spin up to 700 times per second (though other, more extreme pulsars have been found to go even faster). And though they are only 6 miles in diameter (10 km), they are generally about 1.5 times more massive than our own ...
