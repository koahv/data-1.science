#### Extract
>Warping space-time (via Anderson Institute) In the past, we have covered the feasibility of various forms of interstellar space exploration, along with a few of the proposed mechanisms that are based on technologies available to us today. Given NASA&#8217;S recent unveiling of a blueprint fora warp drive spacecraft, it is more important now than ever to put some perspective on a controversial issue and to gauge whether such a thing is actually within the realm of science fact, or if it belongs in science fiction. Motivating Factors For Needing a Warp Drive: To begin, the fastest current man-made object (Helios 2) would take 17 to 18 thousand years to reach our closest star, Proxima Centauri. These proposed spacecraft would reduce the journey time from millennia down to only centuries. Several generations would pass during the trip, and the ship would have to be entirely self-sufficient, recycling all food, waste and air. But what happens when we want to go farther? If we don’t destro...
