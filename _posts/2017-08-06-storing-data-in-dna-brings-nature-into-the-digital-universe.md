#### Extract
>Researchers who hold the world record for storing and retrieving data in DNA explain how the building blocks of life can be used to hold digital information as well. &nbsp; &nbsp; Humanity is producing data at an unimaginable rate, to the point that storage technologies can’t keep up. Every five years, the amount of data we’re producing increases 10-fold, including photos and videos. Not all of it needs to be stored, but manufacturers of data storage aren’t making hard drives and flash chips fast enough to hold what we do want to keep. Since we’re not going to stop taking pictures and recording movies, we need to develop new ways to save them. Over millennia, nature has evolved an incredible information storage medium – DNA. It evolved to s...
