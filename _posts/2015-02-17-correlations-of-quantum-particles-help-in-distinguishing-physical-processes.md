#### Extract
>Glasgow, UK (SPX) Feb 17, 2015 Communication security and metrology could be enhanced through a study of the role of quantum correlations in the distinguishability of physical processes, by researchers at the Universities of Strathclyde and Waterloo. The study involved analysing the impact of quantum steering - the way a measurement performed on a particle can affect another distant particle. The study authors devised a...
