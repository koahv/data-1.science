#### Digest
>"In this research, we determined how cells detect the position of molecules (or ligands) in their surroundings with nanometre precision," says Roca-Cusachs. Researchers proved that by altering the conditions of the cell's environment (rigidity and distribution of those ligands that create the extracellular matrix), they can control the adherence response of the cell, and even define a range in which the cell adheres. Researchers can measure how cells regulate force distribution and the number of ligands to which they adhere regarding their density.

#### Extract
>The process through which cells are able to sense their environment is regulated by force detection. This is the main conclusion of a study published in the journal Nature, led by the team of Pere Roca-Cusachs, lecturer from the Department of Biomedicine and main researcher at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC)....

#### Factsheet
>The process through which cells are able to sense their environment is regulated by force detection. Interaction between cells and their ligands (the cell microenvironment) is essential to maintaining tissue function, and the detection of changes in the cell environment is essential in all situations where there is tissue remodelling, such as embryonic development, tumoral proliferation or the healing of a wound. "Depending on this cell force distribution, it can affect the activation of genetic transcription, a phenomenon that determines which genes are expressed," says Roger Oria.
