> A technique for 'editing' the genome in sperm-producing adult stem cells has been demonstrated by researchers, a result with powerful potential for basic research and for gene therapy. The study involved spermatogonial stem cells, which are the foundation for the production of sperm and are the only adult stem cells that contribute genetic information to the next generation. Repairing flaws in the cells could thus prevent mutations from being passed to future generations, researchers say.
