The tool allows scientists to make precise edits to DNA strands, which could lead to treatments for genetic diseases â€¦ but could also be used to create so-called "designer babies." Doudna reviews how CRISPR-Cas9 works -- and asks the scientific community to pause and discuss the ethics of this new tool.
