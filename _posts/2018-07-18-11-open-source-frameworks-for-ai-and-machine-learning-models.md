#### Extract
>The meteoric rise of artificial intelligence in the last decade has spurred a huge demand for AI and ML skills in todayâ€™s job market. ML-based technology is now used in almost every industry vertical, from finance to healthcare. In this article, I compiled a list of the best frameworks and libraries that you can use to build machine learning models.
1. TensorFlow
Developed by Google, TensorFlow is an open-source software library built for deep learning or artificial neural networks. With TensorFlow, you can create neural networks and computation models using flowgraphs. It is one of the most well-maintained and popular open-source libraries available for deep learning. The TensorFlow framework is available in C++ and Python. Other similar d...
