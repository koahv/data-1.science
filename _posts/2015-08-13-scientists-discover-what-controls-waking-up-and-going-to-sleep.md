> Neuroscientists have discovered how an animal's biological clock wakes it up in the morning and puts it to sleep at night. In studies of fruit flies and mice and the brain circadian neurons governing the daily sleep-wake cycle's timing, the researchers found that high sodium channel activity in these neurons during the day turn the cells on and ultimately awaken an animal, and high potassium channel activity at night turn them off, allowing the animal to sleep.
