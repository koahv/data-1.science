#### Extract
>The results for the May survey are now available for you to take a look at and compare with results from previous months. You can find the new survey for June here, so please fill that out if you haven’t already. Our graph maker Fedso has set colours to answers for some questions, so confusion can be avoided with the AMD/Nvidia/Intel answers which traditionally have their corporate colours associated to them. If anyone has any comments or suggestions to do with this, then make sure to leave them in the comments. There have been no major changes or trends this month, so analysis will be limited to the Unique Questions this month and a couple more which I’d like to comment on. This will also most likely be the norm from now on, since there is only so much one can say about incremental changes. Please click on the images to enlarge. Once enlarged, you can also cycle through them using the arrows. Respondents Many thanks to the 1508 people who took the time to complete this survey!...
