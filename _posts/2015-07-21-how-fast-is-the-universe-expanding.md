>Vesto Slipher’s observations of spiral nebulae in the early 20th century led him to conclude that most spirals, with the exception of a few (such as Andromeda), were receding from Earth. Edwin Hubble confirmed that the spiral nebulae were actually separate galaxies in 1925 when he discovered Cepheid variable stars in Andromeda. These pulsating stars obey a period-luminosity law—essentially, the longer the period of light variation, the brighter the star—which makes it possible to determine their distances. Hubble found that Andromeda was much too distant to be part of our galaxy, confirming what other astronomers previously suspected: the spiral nebulae were actually separate galaxies.Using data from Slipher and others, <a
