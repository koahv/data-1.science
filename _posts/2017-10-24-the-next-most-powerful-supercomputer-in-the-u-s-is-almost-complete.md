#### Extract
>Computing for Science Inside one of the rooms of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) at Tennessee, the next fastest and most powerful supercomputer in the U.S. is getting ready to solve some of science&#8217;s biggest questions. Meet theÂ Summit supercomputer, which is designed to be the predecessor to ORNL&#8217;s current high-performance supercomputer called Titan. Supercomputers have been around for some time now. The high-performance computing these devices are capable of make them ideal for running larger and more complex computational problems, such as those that deal with questions of science. For Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility project director Buddy Bland, these type of big problems would make a good test for Summit&#82...
