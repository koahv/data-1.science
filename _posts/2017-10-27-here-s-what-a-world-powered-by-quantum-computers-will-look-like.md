#### Extract
>Beyond Science Fiction In 1935, Albert Einstein famously collaborated with physicists Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen on a paper designed to illuminate the weaknesses in quantum mechanics, a branch of physics focused on the very small. Though the phenomenon of &#8220;entanglement&#8221; was so new the term hadn&#8217;t even been coined yet, Einstein wasted no time voicing his skepticism of it, calling the &#8220;spooky action at a distance&#8221; simply impossible. Nearly a century later, we now have abundant proof that entanglement is possible. In fact, we&#8217;re now on the brink of building the quantum computers that will allow us to use the phenomenon to answer some of humanity&#8217;s greatest questions. Quantum computers handle and process information in a way far different from that of classical computers. While a classical computer works with bits as information placeholders, a quantum computer works with quantum bits (qubits). While bits carry information in either a 0 or 1...
