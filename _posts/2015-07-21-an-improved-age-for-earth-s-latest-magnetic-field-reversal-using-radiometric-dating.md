#### Extract
>(Research Organization of Information and Systems) The Earth's magnetic field experiences reversals such that north becomes south. The age of the latest reversal is unclear. Researchers from Japan and Canada have dated volcanic ash that was formed immediately before the last reversal. This result and chronology of the associated sedimentary rock identifies the age of the reversal as 770.2 Â± 7.3 thousand years ago. This new age will contribute calibrating the geological time scale....
