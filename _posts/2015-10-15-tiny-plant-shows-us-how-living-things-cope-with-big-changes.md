> A small freshwater plant that has evolved to live in harsh seawater is giving scientists insight into how living things adapt to changes in their environment. In adapting to new surroundings, organisms must develop ways to perform everyday functions, such as securing food and oxygen, and reproducing. The latest study is one of the first to track such a significant lifestyle transition in the lab, instead of relying on fossil clues.
