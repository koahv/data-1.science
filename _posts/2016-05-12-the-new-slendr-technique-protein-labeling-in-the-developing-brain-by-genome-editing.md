#### Extract
>(Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience) Dr. Ryohei Yasuda and his team have developed a method, called SLENDR, that allows precise modification of neuronal DNA in living samples. Using their new technique, the research team were able to reliably label two different proteins with distinct colors at the same time in the same cell. The researchers used a variety of imaging methods as well as DNA sequencing to confirm that the SLENDR method had truly and precisely knocked in the genes....
