#### Extract
>Scientists have used an ultra-bright pulse of X-ray light to turn an atom in a molecule briefly into a sort of electromagnetic black hole. Unlike a black hole in space, the X-rayed atom does not draw in matter from its surroundings through the force of gravity, but electrons with its electrical charge -- causing the molecule to explode within the tiniest fraction of a second. The study provides important information for analyzing biomolecules using X-ray lasers....
