#### Extract
>(World Scientific) A quantum version of General relativity published in the International Journal of Geometric Methods in Modern Physics demonstrates that Dark Energy and Dark Matter are different manifestations of gravity. The theory calculates the precise value of the cosmological constant, derives the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, gives a quantum description of Black Holes and calculates the baryonic mass content of the observable universe.
