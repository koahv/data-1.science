#### Extract
>    Recent data from NASA’s New Horizons probe — which passed within 7,800 miles of the surface on July 14 — have revealed striking features on Pluto's heart-shaped region that indicate the icy dwarf planet may harbor an ocean deep in its interior, according to mission scientists during a July 24 press briefing. They also provided new information about Pluto's thin atmosphere. “We are amazed to see Pluto as dynamic and active as it is,” said Richard Binzel, a New Horizons co-investigator and professor in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences. The latest images of Tombaugh Regio — the heart's official name in honor of Pluto's discoverer, Clyde Tombaugh — show evidence of nitrogen ice similar to Earth’s glaciers, which appear to flow around elevated islands at the heart’s edges.  Until now, scientists have only seen surfaces like this on active worlds such as Earth and Saturn's moon Enceladus. “No one dared imagine such a thick and localized buildup of geolo...
