> (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem) The role of circular RNA, discovered several years ago, is poorly understood. Now, Hebrew University of Jerusalem researchers and their colleagues in Germany have discovered how circular RNA is created. They propose a link to the most common form of muscular dystrophy that begins in adulthood. The research advances our understanding of general molecular biology, and could help our understanding and eventual treatment of degenerative diseases in muscles and the brain.
