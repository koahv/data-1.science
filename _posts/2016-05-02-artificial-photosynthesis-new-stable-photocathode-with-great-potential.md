#### Extract
>(Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin f√ºr Materialien und Energie) A HZB team has developed a new composite photocathode for generating hydrogen using sunlight. The photocathode consists of a thin film of chalcopyrite produced by HZB/PVcomB coated with a newly developed thin film of titanium dioxide containing platinum nanoparticles. This layer protects the chalcopyrite thin film from corrosion, it acts as a catalyst to speed-up formation of hydrogen even shows photoelectric current density and voltage comparable to those of a chalcopyrite-based thin film solar cell....
