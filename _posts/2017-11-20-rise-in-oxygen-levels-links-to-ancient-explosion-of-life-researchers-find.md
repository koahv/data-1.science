#### Digest
>A team of researchers, including a faculty member and postdoctoral fellow from Washington University in St. Louis, found that oxygen levels appear to increase at about the same time as a three-fold increase in biodiversity during the Ordovician Period, between 445 and 485 million years ago, according to a study published Nov. 20 in Nature Geoscience. The researchers concluded that it remained unclear whether the increased oxygenation had a direct effect on animal life, or even if it had a passive effect by, say, expanding the oxygen-rich ecospace. So it is difficult to resolve if temperature, increased oxygenation or something else served as the driver for biodiversification. "Oxygen and animal life have always been linked, but most of the focus has been on how animals came to be," said Saltzman, professor and school director of Earth Sciences at Ohio State. "Our work suggests that oxygen may have been just as important in understanding how animals came to be so diverse and abundant."

#### Extract
>(Washington University in St. Louis) A team of researchers, including a faculty member and postdoctoral fellow from Washington University in St. Louis, found that oxygen levels appear to increase by roughly 80 percent at about the same time as a three-fold increase in biodiversity during the Ordovician Period, between 445 and 485 million years ago, according to a study published Nov. 20 in Nature Geoscience....

#### Factsheet
>The Great Ordovician Bio-diversification Event describes a rise in marine life, ocean floor changes to the Earth and a period with asteroid impacts. It took millions of years for the Earth's atmosphere and shallow ocean to oxygenate - major diversification of life occurred when shallow seas became progressively oxygenated.
