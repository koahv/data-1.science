#### Extract
>(Washington University in St. Louis) A team of researchers, including a faculty member and postdoctoral fellow from Washington University in St. Louis, found that oxygen levels appear to increase by roughly 80 percent at about the same time as a three-fold increase in biodiversity during the Ordovician Period, between 445 and 485 million years ago, according to a study published Nov. 20 in Nature Geoscience....

#### Factsheet
>The Great Ordovician Bio-diversification Event describes a rise in marine life, ocean floor changes to the Earth and a period with asteroid impacts. It took millions of years for the Earth's atmosphere and shallow ocean to oxygenate - major diversification of life occurred when shallow seas became progressively oxygenated.
