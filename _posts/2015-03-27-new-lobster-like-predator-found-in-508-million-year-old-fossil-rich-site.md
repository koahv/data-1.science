#### Extract
>(University of Toronto) What do butterflies, spiders and lobsters have in common? They are all surviving relatives of a newly identified species called Yawunik kootenayi, a marine creature with two pairs of eyes and prominent grasping appendages that lived as much as 508 million years ago -- more than 250 million years before the first dinosaur. It was identified by palaeontologists at the University of Toronto and the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, and Pomona College in California.
