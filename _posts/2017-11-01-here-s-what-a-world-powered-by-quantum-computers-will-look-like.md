#### Digest
>We now have abundant proof that quantum entanglement is possible. Entanglement describes communication of properties between particles that are separated by distance. Quantum computers handle and process information in a way far different from that of classical computers. Qubits are the quantum variety of classical computing informational placeholders - bits. Classical bits state either 0 or 1, whereas a qubit may be 0 or 1 simultaneously. This is called quantum superposition. Quantum computers will be capable of performing vastly more complicated computations than classical computers.
