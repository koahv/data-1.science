#### Digest
>Targeted motor and sensory re-innervation (TMSR) is a surgical procedure on patients with amputations that reroutes residual limb nerves towards intact muscles and skin in order to fit them with a limb prosthesis. TMSR changes the way the brain processes motor control and somatosensory input. A patient fitted with a TMSR prosthetic "sends" motor commands to the reinnervated muscles, where his or her movement intentions are decoded and sent to the prosthetic limb while direct stimulation of the skin over the re-innervated muscles is sent back to the brain, inducing touch perception on the missing limb. Ultra-high field 7 Tesla fMRI is an exceptional tool for studying the upper-limb maps of the motor and somatosensory cortex following amputation. The study also shows that there is a need of further engineering advances such as the integration of somatosensory feedback into current prosthetics that can enable them to move and feel as real limbs.

#### Extract
>(Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) EPFL scientists from the Center for Neuroprosthetics have used functional MRI to show how the brain re-maps motor and sensory pathways following targeted motor and sensory reinnervation (TMSR), a neuroprosthetic approach where residual limb nerves are rerouted towards intact muscles and skin regions to control a robotic limb....
