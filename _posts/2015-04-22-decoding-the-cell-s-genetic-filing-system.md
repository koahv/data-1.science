#### Extract
>(Princeton  University) A fully extended strand of human DNA measures about five feet in length. Yet it occupies a space just one-tenth of a cell by wrapping itself around histones -- spool-like proteins -- to form a dense hub of information called chromatin. Researchers at Princeton University have developed a facile method to introduce non-native chromatin into cells to interrogate nature's remarkable information indexing system.
