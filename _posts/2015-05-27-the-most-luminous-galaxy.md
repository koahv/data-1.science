#### Extract
>An artist's depiction of the most luminous galaxy, from NASA / JPL - Caltech Researchers using NASA’s Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have discovered the most luminous galaxy to date. Dubbed WISE J224607.57-052635.0, this Extremely Luminous Infrared Galaxy (ELIRG) shines brighter in the infrared than 300 trillion suns and has an exceptionally supermassive black hole at its core. The sheer size of this black hole-gargantua is one of a few such entities that leave astronomers scratching their heads as to how in the world (or in this case, the universe) such giants can grow so big so quickly. We still don’t quite know the answer, but astronomers have a few ideas. One idea involves the collapse of the universe’s earliest stars. Made only of hydrogen, helium, and some other Big Bang leftovers, these stars initially contained no heavier elements.  With no way to cool down the heat of gravitational collapse, they were able to grow much bigger than the metal-rich stars of today’s un...
