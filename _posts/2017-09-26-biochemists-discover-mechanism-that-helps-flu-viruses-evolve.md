>Flu viruses' rapid evolution relies in part on hijacking some of the cellular machinery of the infected host cell -- a group of proteins called chaperones, which help other proteins fold into the correct shape. When viruses are unable to get help from these proteins, they do not evolve as rapidly, research shows....
