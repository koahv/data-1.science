> (Science China Press) Equipped with the latest homegrown many-core SW26010 processor, the Sunway TaihuLight Supercomputer is the first system in the world to provide a peak performance of over 100 PFlops. With 260 processing elements within one chip, one single SW26010 is providing a peak performance of over three TFlops. Preliminary work using TaihuLight has achieved promising results on key scientific applications such as Earth system modeling, ocean surface wave modeling, atomistic simulation, and phase-field simulation.
