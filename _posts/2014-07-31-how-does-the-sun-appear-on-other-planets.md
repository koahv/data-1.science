#### Extract
>Question: 
&#8220;I was recently thinking about how big the sun looks on our planet. I then started to wonder how big it would look on Mars then Jupiter, Saturn. So on so forth until we reached little Pluto. So I ask, how big would our personal star look on all the planets? Including Mercury and Venus.&#8221;

Answer:
This image only covers the 8 large planets in our solar system. So naturally, Pluto, Ceres, Eris, Makemake or Haumea (or any of the larger KBOs, for that matter) aren&#8217;t covered.
To answer that portion of your question, on average Pluto is about 39 times farther from the Sun than the Earth is. (Which would generally make it 3.67 billion miles [5.91 billion km] away from the sun, on average.) If you were standing on Pluto, the Sun would appear 1/39th (or 0.026 times) of the size we see here on Earth. At its closest, it is 2.75 billion miles (4.4 billion km) from the sun. Yet at its at its closest point and 4.53 billion miles (7.29 billion km) at it&#8217;s furthest. At such a vast distance, it would appear to be just another star. Albeit, an extremely bright one that would hurt your eyes if you looked at it directly.
As a side note, one should keep in mind that Pluto has an extremely elliptical orbit. Sometimes, it crosses into Neptune&#8217;s orbit and the Sun is actually closer to Pluto than to Neptune! (This actually occurs some 20 years out of each 247.68 year orbit, which is pretty insignificant, but still cool never-the-less.)
To avoid any confusion, the little spaceship seen in each frame is irrelevant to the message. I believe the original designer put them there to help establish how much light the sun generates on each planet. (Each comparison was based on the approximate apparent visual magnitude of the sun for each planet)
