On November 3, the EPA approved the release of male Asian tiger mosquitoes infected with a bacterium that prevents them from successfully reproducing. Kentucky-based biotech company MosquitoMate infected the lab-grown male mosquitoes with Wolbachia pipientis, a naturally occurring bacteria found in many insects.
