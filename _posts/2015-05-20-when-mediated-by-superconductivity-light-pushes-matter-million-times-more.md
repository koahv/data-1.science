When a mirror reflects light, it experiences a slight push. This radiation pressure can be increased considerably with the help of a small superconducting island. This was revealed by the joint research done in the Aalto University and the Universities of Jyvaskyla and Oulu. 

The finding paves a way for the studies of mechanical oscillations at the level of a single photon, the quantum of l...
