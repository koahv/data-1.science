>Intrusion detection: Linux rootkits Rootkits Rootkits are installed components on a server by a person with malicious intent. The main goal is hiding its presence and avoid the eye of the system administrator. Rootkits usually consist of a set of tools, to manipulate the Linux kernel, alter output to the screen or avoid some software from doing its tasks. Nowadays rootkits are less popular than they were before. One of the reasons is the increased security in the Linux kernel, making it harder to circumvent some areas (like using some system calls). Still they occur, or in a slightly different form. For example backdoors are still very popular. Often the attacker doesn&#8217;t even need full root access to abuse a system for other purposes....
