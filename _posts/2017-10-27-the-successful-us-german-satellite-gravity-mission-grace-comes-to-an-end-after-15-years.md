>(GFZ GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam, Helmholtz Centre) On March 17, 2002, the twin satellites of the NASA/German Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) were launched in order to make precise measurements of the Earth´s gravity field. GRACE has lasted three times as long as originally planned for more than 15 years. Now it has ended science operations....

#### Factsheet
>On March 17, 2002, the twin satellites of the NASA/German Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) were launched in order to make precise measurements of the Earth´s gravity field. GRACE has lasted three times as long as originally planned for more than 15 years. Now it has ended science operations. GRACE-2 is currently orbiting at 305.3 kilometers above Earth, 655 kilometers ahead of and 1,3 kilometers below GRACE-1. With GRACE-2 out of fuel, atmospheric drag on the satellite will increase the separation distance and lower GRACE-2's altitude relative to GRACE-1. There is no risk of a collision with GRACE-1, and GRACE-2's orbital altitude does not pose a hazard to other operational satellites. Each of the twin GRACE satellites operates by transmitting microwave signals that are received by the other GRACE satellite. The timing of the received signals is used to precisely measure the small accelerations and decelerations caused by changing mass on the Earth below the spacecraft, which alter the distance between them very slightly. GRACE's monthly maps of regional variations in global gravity over the past 15-plus years have shown how water, ice and solid Earth material on or near Earth's surface has moved.
