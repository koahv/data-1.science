#### Extract
>We now have a clean, cheap way of manufacturing quantum dots, an advanced, microscopic tool that scientists are learning how to use to enhance everything from solar panels to cancer treatments. All they needed was green tea leaf extract, along with a couple other chemicals.
But let’s back up, because that’s a lot to take in. Quantum dots are a kind of nanoparticle that span from two to five nanometers. For reference, the antibodies that your immune system uses to swarm harmful viruses or bacteria are ten nanometers wide, and a human hair is about 40,000 nanometers wide. Lately, researchers have been trying to find new ways of using them in biomedical research and other advanced nanotechnology that requires the smallest possible particles.
