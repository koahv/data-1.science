> Mars. It's a pretty unforgiving place. On this dry, dessicated world, the average surface temperature is -55 째C (-67 째F). And at the poles, temperatures can reach as low as  -153 째C (243 째F). Much of that has to do with its thin atmosphere, which is too thin to retain heat (not to mention breathe). So why then is the idea of colonizing Mars so intriguing to us?
