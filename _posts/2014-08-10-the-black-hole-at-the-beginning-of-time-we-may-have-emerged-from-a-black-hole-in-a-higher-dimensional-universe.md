Conventional understanding holds that the big bang began with a singularity – an unfathomably hot and dense phenomenon of spacetime where the standard laws of physics break down. Singularities are bizarre, and our understanding of them is limited. Our universe may have emerged from a black hole in a higher-dimensional universe, proposed a trio of Perimeter Institute researchers in the cover story of the latest Scientific American. “Cosmology’s greatest challenge is understanding the big bang itself,” write Perimeter Institute faculty member, Niayesh Afshordi. The big bang poses a big question: if it was indeed the cataclysm that blasted our universe into existence 13.7 billion years ago, what sparked it? Three Perimeter Institute researchers have a new idea about what might have come bef...
