#### Extract
>There are eight planets in the solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The four inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) fall under the category of terrestrial planets, while the outer four (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) are the gas and ice giants.<div

Pluto was demoted from its planetary status in 2006 when a body of scientists decided a formalized definition for the term “planet.” According to the <a

Instead, it is classified as a <a
