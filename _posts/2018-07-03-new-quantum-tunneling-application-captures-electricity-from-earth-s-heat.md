Researchers at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia have learned how to produce electricity from Earth&#8217;s excess heat through quantum tunneling. Quantum tunneling is a phenomenon in which particles are able to tunnel through a barrier that, under the rules of classical mechanics, they are usually unable to pass through. First predicted in the early 20th century and generally accepted by mid-century, quantum tunneling plays an important applied role in devices such as the tunnel diode, quantum computing, and the scanning tunneling microscope. Using quantum tunneling to harvest electricity from Earth&#8217;s radiant heat involves a specifically designed antenna that can identify this excess heat as ...
