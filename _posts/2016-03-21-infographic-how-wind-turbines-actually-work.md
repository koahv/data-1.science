>  We&#8217;ve all driven by a wind turbine farm and looked up in wonder. What are these alien-like contraptions that are taking up this entire hillside? They are quite unique, which makes the first, second, or third time seeing them while speeding along on the freeway equally jarring. What makes these contraptions so interesting is their mystique. How do they work? What&#8217;s their purpose? Why do they only exist in the middle of nowhere? Why are they so unlike anything else energy related? To uncover the mystery, Save On Energy put together this fun infographic to explain how wind turbines work in a way that&#8217;s easy and accessible. It&#8217;ll help make the conversation on your next road trip a lot more interesting! Read the rest of INFOGRAPHIC: How wind turbines actually work
