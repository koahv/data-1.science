#### Extract
>Explaining the process of how any of us might have arrived to a particular conclusion or decision by verbally detailing the variables, weights, and conditions that our brains navigate through to arrive at an answer can be complex enough. But what happens when we ask a neural network, which itself is based on the loose architecture of our own brains, how it arrived at a particular conclusion? In neural networks and artificial intelligence research, the difficulty for the system to provide a suitable explanation for how it arrived at an answer is referred to as “the black box problem.” Just &#8230; The Black Box Problem Closes in on Neural Networks was written by Nicole Hemsoth at The Platform....
