#### Extract
>QISKit ACQUA Bridges Classical, Quantum Computing 
Working with real quantum computers just got easier for experts in chemistry, artificial intelligence,&nbsp;and optimization. Building on QISKit, our open source quantum information science kit for software development, we’ve released ACQUA — Algorithms and Circuits for Quantum Applications. This new open source software allows classical computer applications to send complex operations to be run on quantum computers, over the cloud. 
Let me start by explaining the quantum software stack, and where QISKit and ACQUA fit. At the lowest level is the hardware where the qubits sit at the very cold temperature of 15 mK. The qubits receive microwave pulse signals for a calculation, which have been ...
