#### Extract
>The protein BEM46 is found in all creatures having a nucleus. Mammals have several copies of this gene whereas fungus have only one copy. Some years ago the bem46 gene was named under the top ten of the "known-unknown genes". Scientists of Kiel University show for the first time the link between bem46 and reproduction as well as growth processes in fungus. These findings have been published online on June, 13th in the scientific magazine Eukaryotic Cell.
