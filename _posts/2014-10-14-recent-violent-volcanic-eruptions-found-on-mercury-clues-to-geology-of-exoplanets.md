Scientists examining volcanic deposits on the surface of the planet using NASA’s MESSENGER spacecraft found evidence of explosive activity as recently as a billion years ago. Previous studies of the cratering of other lava flows placed most volcanic activity at more than 3.5 billion years in the past.
Rocky planets like Mercury in orbit around other stars could have similar volcanic activity, releasing volatiles useful for the evolution of life at the surface. With temperatures ranging from -280 to 800 degrees Fahrenheit (-173 to 427 degrees Celsius), Mercury is not habitable, but similar rocky bodies around smaller, cooler stars would lie in their star’s habitable zone, the region where liquid water could exist on the surface....
