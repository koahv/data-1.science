#### Extract
>       “The Suzaku satellite has opened a brand new window on the Universe and shown us that wherever you look, over vast scales, the mix of chemical elements is essentially the same" said Steven Allen, Professor of Physics at Stanford University and co-author of the study. "It's a beautifully simple result, and another step in understanding how the Universe around us came to be.” All of the chemical elements that are heavier than carbon, the oxygen we breathe, the silicon that makes up the sand on the beach, were produced inside stars through nuclear fusion and released by stellar explosions called supernovae. By measuring the chemical composition of the Universe, scientists are trying to reconstruct the history of how, when, and wher...
