#### Extract
>(Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) Neuroscientists today publish in Neuron details of a revolutionary new way of mapping the brain at the resolution of individual neurons, which they have successfully demonstrated in the mouse brain. It involves introducing unique RNA barcodes into individual neurons and later identifying these barcodes, via sequencing, in distant brain areas.
