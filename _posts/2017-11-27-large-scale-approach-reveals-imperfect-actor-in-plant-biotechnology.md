#### Digest
>A research team led by Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research has harnessed metabolomic technologies to unravel the molecular activities of a key protein that can enable plants to withstand a common herbicide. Their findings reveal how the protein -- a kind of catalyst or enzyme, first isolated in bacteria and introduced into plants, including crops such as corn and soybeans, in the 1990's-- can sometimes act imprecisely, and how it can be successfully re-engineered to be more precise. An enzyme called BAR was engineered into the plants as a kind of chemical beacon, enabling scientists to more readily study them.

#### Factsheet
>Plants provide an extraordinary model for scientists to study how metabolism changes over time. Because they cannot escape from predators or search for new food sources when supplies run low, plants must often grapple with an array of environmental insults using what is readily available -- their own internal biochemistry. Plants have rapidly evolving metabolic systems. BAR is one of the most commonly deployed traits in genetically modified crops, such as soybeans, corn, and cotton, enabling them to withstand a widely-used herbicide
