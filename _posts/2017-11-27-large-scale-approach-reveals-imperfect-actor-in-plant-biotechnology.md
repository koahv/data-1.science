#### Extract
>(Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research) A research team led by Whitehead Institute has unraveled the molecular activities of a key protein that can enable plants to withstand a common herbicide. Their findings reveal how the protein can sometimes act imprecisely, and how it can be successfully re-engineered to be more precise....

#### Factsheet
>Because they cannot escape from predators or search for new food sources when supplies run low, plants must often grapple with an array of environmental insults using what is readily available -- their own internal biochemistry.
