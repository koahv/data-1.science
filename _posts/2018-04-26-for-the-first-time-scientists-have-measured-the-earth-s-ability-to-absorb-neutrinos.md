Neutrinos are infinitesimally small and nearly massless particles that are all around us at any given moment. Roughly one trillion neutrinos from the Sun pass through a human&#8217;s eyes every second, but since they interact so rarely with anything, observing them is extremely difficult despite their pervasiveness. Now, scientists from the Department of Energy&#8217;s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and UC Berkeley have used data collected from the IceCube array in Antarctica to show that the Earth itself can absorb neutrinos.
Their study has been published in the journal Nature.
The IceCube array consists of 5,160 basketball-sized optical sensors buried 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) deep in a cubic k...
