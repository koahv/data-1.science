> Enzo di Fabrizio and his team have developed a new technique to produce a direct image of the DNA helix and its inner structure. This is the first time scientists have ever been able to produce an image of DNA that allows a direct visual evaluation of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the building blocks of life. The study is thought to open a whole new field of genetics research and nanobiology, giving the world a new tool to understand how proteins and other biomolecules interact within the DNA and the epigenetic influences.
