#### Extract
>(International School of Advanced Studies (SISSA)) Under extremely high pressure conditions oxygen molecules group into quartets and give rise to a 'dance of their magnetic moments.' This, as observed in a new study carried out by SISSA in collaboration with ICTP and published in PNAS, results in magnetic properties never previously observed in these conditions and in theory points to the existence of a new phase of the element, called epsilon 1....
