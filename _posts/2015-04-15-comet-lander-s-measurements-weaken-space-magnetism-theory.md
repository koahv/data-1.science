#### Extract
>Whatever caused small space rocks to lump together billions of years ago, magnetism is unlikely to be the reason.

Scientists said Tuesday that measurements made by the European space probe Philae, which landed on comet 67P in November, show the comet's core isn't magnetized.

The findings add to scientists' understanding of how comets and even planets formed, because some astrophysicists had theorized that magnetism might have been responsible for aligning and then binding together rocks into larger boulders.Read more about Comet Lander&#039;s Measurements Weaken Space Magnetism Theory Comments...
