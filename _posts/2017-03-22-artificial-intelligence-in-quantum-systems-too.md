#### Extract
>(University of the Basque Country ) The UPV/EHU's Department of Physical Chemistry has conducted world-class research in physics and quantum computation. This has led to the coining of a new term: quantum biomimetics, which consists of reproducing in quantum systems certain properties exclusive of living entities.  Specifically, they have imitated natural selection, learning and memory. These mechanisms developed could give quantum computation a boost and facilitate the learning process in machines....
