#### Extract
>(CNRS) Scientists in the LIGO and Virgo collaborations, including teams from the CNRS, have achieved the first ever three-detector observation of the gravitational waves emitted by the merger of two black holes. This is the first signal detected by the Advanced Virgo instrument and confirms that it is fully operational. It opens the way to considerably more accurate localization of the sources of gravitational waves.
