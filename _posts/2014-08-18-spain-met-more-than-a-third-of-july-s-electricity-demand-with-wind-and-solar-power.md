#### Extract
>July was a banner month in Spain in terms of renewable energy production with 34 percent of the country&#8217;s energy needs being met by wind and solar energy. Wind was the prominent low-carbon energy source in the Iberian Peninsula, providing 30 percent of the country&#8217;s energy needs, while solar power supplied about 4 percent. July&#8217;s renewable energy output is particularly noteworthy considering that the total combined energy provided by wind and solar in the entire first six months of 2014 only reached approximately 25.3 percent.
