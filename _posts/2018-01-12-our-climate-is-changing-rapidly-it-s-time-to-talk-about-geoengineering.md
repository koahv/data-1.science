#### Extract
>Tinkering With the Climate
Planet Earth is humankind&#8217;s biggest experiment. From the moment we figured out how to use fire and altered the land through farming, humanity turned the planet into an immense, long-term experiment of what happens when we tinker with the types and quantities of gases in the atmosphere.
Recent advances in technology, along with the sheer number of humans alive today, sped up this experiment, and the initial results indicate that our impact may not be a positive one. Studies suggest it&#8217;s unlikely that humanity will be able to keep Earth&#8217;s average temperature from rising less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial temperatures, the oft-cited &#8220;tipping point&#8221; ...
