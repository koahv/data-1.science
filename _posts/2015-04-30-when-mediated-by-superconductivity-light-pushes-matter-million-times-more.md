#### Extract
>Helsinki, Finland (SPX) Apr 30, 2015 When a mirror reflects light, it experiences a slight push. This radiation pressure can be increased considerably with the help of a small superconducting island. This was revealed by the joint research done in the Aalto University and the Universities of Jyvaskyla and Oulu. The finding paves a way for the studies of mechanical oscillations at the level of a single photon, the quantum of l...
