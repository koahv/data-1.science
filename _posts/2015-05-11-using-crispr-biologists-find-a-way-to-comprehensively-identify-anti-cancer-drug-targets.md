> (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) Imagine having a complete catalog of the best drug targets to hit in a deadly form of cancer. Imagine having a master catalog of such targets for all major cancers. Scientists at CSHL have published a method of doing precisely this, using the revolutionary gene-editing technology called CRISPR.
