#### Extract
>Although treatment advances have dramatically reduced deaths from opportunistic infections related to AIDS, a new study drawing on 30 years of data from more than 20,000 patients in San Francisco suggests there is still ample room to improve. About a third -- 35 percent -- of AIDS patients diagnosed with their first opportunistic infection from 1997 to 2012 in that city died within five years, according to the study.
