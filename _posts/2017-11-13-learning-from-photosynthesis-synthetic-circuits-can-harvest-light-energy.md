#### Digest
>Now, Hao Yan and Neal Woodbury from ASU's Biodesign Institute and colleagues from Harvard and MIT, explore new methods to capitalize on Nature's light-harvesting secrets. Their new study outlines the design of a synthetic system for energy gathering, conversion and transport that may point the way to innovations in solar energy, materials science, nanotechnology and photonics."The ability to model and build molecular circuits for gathering light energy and moving it around in a controlled fashion, opens the door for the design and development of a variety of nano-scale devices that are powered and controlled by light," Woodbury said. The design of excitonic circuits like the one described could lead to new applications beyond light-harvesting technology, including innovations in information and communications technology, and advances in fields ranging from the environment, transportation, healthcare, manufacturing and energy.

>The green sulfur bacterium makes its home in the chilly waters of the Black Sea. To eke out its lonely existence, this life form scavenges energy from the feeble sunlight available to it at a depth of over 250 feet....

#### Factsheet
>Plants carry out photosynthesis by converting photons of light striking their chromophores into another form of energy known as an exciton. An exciton is an energetic state of a molecule, or closely coupled group of molecules after they are excited by light absorption. Quantum coherence is light excitation that can be shared between molecules which can enhance energy transfer efficiency. Photosynthesis describes the process plants' use to convert energy from the sun and convert it into biological energy for growth. Virtually all life on earth relies directly or indirectly on photosynthesis. Organisms using photosynthesis are able to collect sunlight energy and transport it to reaction centers where the energy may be harnessed.
