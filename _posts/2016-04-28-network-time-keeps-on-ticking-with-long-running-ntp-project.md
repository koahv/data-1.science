#### Extract
>“Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.” This quote from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is the title of a recent article by George V. Neville-Neil in the Communications of the ACM that takes an in-depth look at how time is kept for individual machines and across computer networks. The article mentions one approach to improving computer timekeeping that has been around since the 1980s: the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
