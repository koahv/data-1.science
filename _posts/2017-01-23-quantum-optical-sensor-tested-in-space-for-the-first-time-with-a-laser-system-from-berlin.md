> For the first time ever, a cloud of ultra-cold atoms has been successfully created in space on board of a sounding rocket. The MAIUS mission demonstrates that quantum optical sensors can be operated even in harsh environments like space â€“ a prerequisite for finding answers to the most challenging questions of fundamental physics and an important innovation driver for everyday applications.
