#### Extract
>Artist&#8217;s rendition of the Earth and Sun. It may not seem like it to us, but our planet is moving at incredible speeds. In fact, every hour, our planet moves approximately 67,000 miles  (or 107,000) in its orbit around the Sun. But how do we know this? After all, it&#8217;s not like there is a great cosmic radar that we can look at in order to clock our speed. It may seem like a rather difficult question to answer, but really, it only requires a little knowledge of geometry. To begin with, we know that the Earth completes one orbit every 365 days. Well, technically, a year is just a little longer than this. In truth, a years is actually 365.25 days long. That&#8217;s why, every four years, we have an extra day (we&#8217;re playing a bit of catchup with those quarter days). But in order to make things simple, let&#8217;s just round down to a nice 365. We also know that our planet is about 93 million miles from the Sun (some 150 million km) from the Sun, and that it travels in a nea...
