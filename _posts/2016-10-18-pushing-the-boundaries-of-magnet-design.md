#### Extract
>(Springer) A Russian team has been pushing the boundaries of magnet design, as published in a recent study in EPJ Plus. They have developed methods to counter the spontaneous loss of magnetization, based on their understanding of the underlying physical phenomenon. Roman Morgunov from the Russian Academy of Sciences and colleagues have now developed a simple additive-based method for ensuring the stability of permanent magnets over time, with no loss to their main magnetic characteristics....
