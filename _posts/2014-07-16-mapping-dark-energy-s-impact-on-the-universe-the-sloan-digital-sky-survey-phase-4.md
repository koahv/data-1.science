Already, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey has registered more than half a million stars in the Milky Way (a portion of which is shown in the image above) and more than two million galaxies and quasars. The new, fourth phase of the survey broadens the project’s scope and will dramatically expand its database. A major component will focus on mapping the distribution of galaxies and quasars from 3 to 8 billion years ago. During that period, dark energy began to have an impact on the universe. “The power of a large survey is that there may be surprises we weren’t planning on, and that means learning something really new,” said C. Megan Urry, Yale’s Israel Munson Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics and director of the Yale Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics. “One of the things my group is really excited about is the possibility of getting more information...
