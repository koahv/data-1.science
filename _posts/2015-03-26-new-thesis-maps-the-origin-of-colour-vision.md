#### Extract
>Roughly 500 million years ago, the genome of vertebrate animals' early ancestors doubled in size, not just once but twice. This meant that suddenly there were several gene copies which were free to develop new functions. Many of them came to use at different points in time or in new cell types. Then, about 350 million years ago, another doubling of the genome occurred in the ancestor of ray-finned fishes. These ancient events were of dramatic consequences to the evolution of eye-sight.
