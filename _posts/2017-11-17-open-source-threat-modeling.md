#### Digest
>Threat modeling can be usefully done with a pen, whiteboard and one or more security-aware people who understand how their application is built, and this is MUCH better than not threat modeling at all. However, to do it effectively with multiple people and multiple project iterations you need a tool. Commercial tools are available, and Microsoft provides a free tool for Windows only, but established, free, open-source, cross-platform tools are non-existent. OWASP Threat Dragon aims to fill this gap.

#### Extract
>A guest blog post by Mike Goodwin. What is threat modeling? Application threat modeling is a structured approach to identifying ways that an adversary might try to attack an application and then designing mitigations to prevent, detect or reduce the impact of those attacks. The description of an applicationâ€™s threat model is identified as one of the criteria for the Linux CII Best Practises Silver badge. Why threat modeling? It is well established that defense-in-depth is a key principle for network security and the same is true for application security. But although most application developers will intuitively understand this as a concept, it can be hard to put it into practice. After many years and sleepless nights, worrying and fretting...

#### Factsheet
>Application threat modeling is a structured approach to identifying ways that an adversary might try to attack an application and then designing mitigations to prevent, detect or reduce the impact of those attacks. Threat modeling is an exceptionally powerful technique for building defense-in-depth into an application design. It is also great for identifying security flaws at design time where they are cheap and easy to correct. These kinds of flaws are often subtle and hard to detect by traditional testing approaches.
