#### Extract
>(NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center) Slightly larger than a cereal box, the Dellingr CubeSat will study the charged particles of Earth's outer atmosphere, which can drive changes in our space weather and impact satellites. Dellingr construction is complete, and rigorous spacecraft testing is about to begin.
