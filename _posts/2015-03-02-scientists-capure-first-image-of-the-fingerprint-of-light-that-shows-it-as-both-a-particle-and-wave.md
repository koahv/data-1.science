#### Extract
>This amazing image also shows many electrons revealing the &#8220;fingerprint&#8221; of light itself. Image via EPFL For some time, we have known that light is both a particle and a wave. At least, it behaves like a particle and a wave; however, seeing both at the same time is no easy feat. For decades, scientists have been trying to directly observe both of these features. Now, they have finally done it. For the first time ever, scientists have captured a snapshot of this duality. Although quantum mechanics tells us that light simultaneously acts like a particle and wave, until now, we have only been able to observe its wave-like or particle-like properties&#8230;we could only see it as one or the other. Yet, thanks to a surprising new app...
