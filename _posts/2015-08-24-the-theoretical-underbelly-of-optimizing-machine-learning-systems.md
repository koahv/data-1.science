#### Extract
>This week we will be delving into systems and architectures designed for machine learning, but since itâ€™s Monday and there is quite a bit to come, it seemed worthwhile to take a step back and consider how architects and software developers are thinking about the current landscape. With everyone from Intel touting the next generation deep learning and machine learning as a partial basis for their Altera buy, to webscale companies like Microsoft, Google, Baidu and others seeking ways to boost machine learning algorithms with hardware, accelerator, and of course, software approaches, the larger conversations tend to get lost in &#8230; The Theoretical Underbelly of Optimizing Machine Learning Systems was written by Nicole Hemsoth at The Platf...
