#### Extract
>The Sun’s outer atmosphere, the corona, is the source of the solar wind, a steady outflow of charged particles from the Sun. These particles have gained enough energy to fill the heliosphere, a region of space that extends well past the orbit of Pluto. As these particles flow past Earth’s orbit, they’re traveling at an average of 400 kilometers per second. Though the Sun can lose more than a million tons of material each second, the amount is still negligible compared to the Sun’s total mass.<div id="attachment_255425889" style="width: 259px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://d366w3m5tf0813.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/solar-wind.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-255425889" src="http://d366w3m5tf0813.cloudfront.net/wp-c...
