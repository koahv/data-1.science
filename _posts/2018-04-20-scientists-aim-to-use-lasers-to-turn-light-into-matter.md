Scientists at Imperial College London are attempting to use powerful lasers turn light into matter, potentially proving the 84-year-old theory known as the Breit-Wheeler process. According to this theory, it is technically possible to turn light into matter by smashing two photons to create a positron and an electron. While previous efforts to achieve this feat have required added high-energy particles, the Imperial scientists believe they have discovered a method that does not need additional energy to function. &#8220;This would be a pure demonstration of Einstein&#8217;s famous equation that relates energy and mass: E=mc2, which tells us how much energy is produced when matter is turned to energy,&#8221; explained Imperial Professor Ste...
