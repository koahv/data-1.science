#### Extract
>A new physical effect has been discovered: Researchers have found a change of electrical resistance in magnetic whirls. Tiny magnetic whirls – so called skyrmions – are being considered as promising candidates for bits in future robust and compact data storage devices. These exotic magnetic structures were recently found to exist in ultrathin magnetic layers and multilayers, similar to the ones used in current hard-disk drives and magnetic sensors. However, up to now an additional magnet was necessary for a read-out of skyrmions....
