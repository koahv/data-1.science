A team from the University of New South Wales, Australia, just set a new world record for solar energy efficiency by successfully converting 40.4% of available sunlight into electricity. And what&#8217;s even more remarkable is the fact that the record was achieved by using commercially available solar cells in a new way &#8211; which means, as the team explains, &#8220;these efficiency improvements are readily accessible to the solar industry.&#8221;
