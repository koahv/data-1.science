#### Extract
>The ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN has made a precise measurement of the difference between ratios of the mass and electric charge of light nuclei and antinuclei. The result confirms a fundamental symmetry of nature to an unprecedented precision for light nuclei. The measurements are based on the ALICE experimentâ€™s abilities to track and identify particles produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at the LHC....
