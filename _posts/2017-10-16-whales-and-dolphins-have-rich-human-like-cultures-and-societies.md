#### Extract
>(University of Manchester) Whales and dolphins (cetaceans) live in tightly-knit social groups, have complex relationships, talk to each other and even have regional dialects -- much like human societies.  A major new study, published today in Nature Ecology & Evolution, has linked the complexity of Cetacean culture and behavior to the size of their brains.
