#### Extract
>(University of Chicago Medical Center) A single chance mutation caused an ancient protein to evolve a new function essential for multicellularity in animals, about a billion years ago, according to research co-led by UChicago scientists. By conducting experiments on 'resurrected' ancestral proteins, the researchers shed light on the origin of a molecular process that allows animals to form and maintain organized tissues. The study is the first to experimentally describe a molecular mechanism involved in the evolution of multicellularity....
