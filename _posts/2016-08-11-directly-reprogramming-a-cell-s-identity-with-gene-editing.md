#### Extract
>(Duke University) Researchers have used a gene editing tool called CRISPR to turn cells isolated from mouse connective tissue directly into neuronal cells. Results indicate that the newly converted neuronal cells show a more complete conversion than previous techniques, which persists after the treatment has ended. These cells could be used for modeling neurological disorders, discovering new therapeutics, developing personalized medicines and, perhaps in the future, implementing cell therapy.
