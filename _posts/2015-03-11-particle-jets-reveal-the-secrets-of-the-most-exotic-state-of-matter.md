#### Extract
>(The Henryk Niewodniczanski Institute of Nuclear Physics Polish Academy of Sciences) Shortly following the Big Bang, the Universe was filled with a chaotic primordial soup of quarks and gluons, particles which are now trapped inside of protons and neutrons. Study of this quark-gluon plasma requires the use of the most advanced theoretical and experimental tools. Physicists from the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider has taken one crucial step towards a better understanding of the plasma and its properties, and recently published the results of their latest analysis....
