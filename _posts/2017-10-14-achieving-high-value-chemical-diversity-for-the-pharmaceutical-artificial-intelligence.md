#### Digest
>Insilico Medicine is adapting neural network architectures for drug discovery. These advances are usually integrated into a comprehensive drug discovery pipeline with the goal to enable deep neural networks to produce perfect molecules for the specific set of diseases. DruGAN allows the generation of new formulations for a wide range of diseases: different cancers, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, virus infections, and more.
