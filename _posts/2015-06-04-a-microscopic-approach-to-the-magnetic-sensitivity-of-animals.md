#### Extract
>(University of Tokyo) Researchers at the University of Tokyo have developed a new instrument for imaging the magnetosensitivity of photochemical reactions on a submicron scale. This instrument may allow scientists to directly observe processes believed to be responsible for animal magnetoreception inside living cells....
