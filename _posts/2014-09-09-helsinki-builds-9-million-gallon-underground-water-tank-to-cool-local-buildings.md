#### Extract
>Just when you thought Scandinavia couldn’t get any more eco-friendly, Helsinki ups the ante. The Finnish capital recently announced some major environmental initiatives aimed at making the city smarter and greener. The coolest of these may be the installation of a giant underwater reservoir tank built 100 yards below the city center to store 9 million gallons of cold lake water that will be used to cool homes connected to the city’s rapidly-expanding district cooling network. After the water circulates through the cooling system during the day, it’s cooled in the tank overnight using heat exchangers to prepare for its next run the following day. According to a City of Helsinki press release, this latest addition to the city’s smart cooling system means it now emits 80 percent less greenhouse gasses from cooling, compared to conventional cooling systems.
