>At TED2016, Jennifer Kahn talked about a bold new step in biotech: gene drives, the act of systematically removing a pesky gene from an entire species. Photo: Ryan Lash To celebrate 10 years of TED Talks, we went back through the archives to show you how fast biotechnology has changed over the past ten years, and some interesting moments along the way. We start with some history in a talk by James Watson, who co-discovered the first models of DNA’s structure with his partner Francis Crick, as a 23-year-old student at Cambridge in the early 1950s. Onstage in 2005, Watson talked about the breakthrough day when it all become clear. As he describes it, “Crick and I started building models, and I&#8217;d learned a little chemistry, but not enough. Well, we got the answer on the 28th February &#8217;53, because of a rule which, to me, is a very good rule: Never be the brightest person in a room. And we weren&#8217;t.
