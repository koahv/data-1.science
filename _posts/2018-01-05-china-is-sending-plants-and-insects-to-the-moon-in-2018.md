#### Extract
>Going to the Moon
For many, humanity&#8217;s first steps on the Moon are a triumphant relic of modern history, the unparalleled glory of which will be replaced once we reach our next destination: Mars. However, in recent years, other have expressed an interest in returning to scene of humankind&#8217;s giant leap for further exploration.
This year, the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program (CLEP), otherwise known as the Chang&#8217;e Program, plans to launch the Chang&#8217;e 4 Mission. The program has previously sent two orbiters and one lander to the Moon, and now, they plan to study its geology while exploring the effects of lunar gravity on both insects and plants from Earth.
Plants and insects will be on the Moon fairly soon. Image Credit:...
