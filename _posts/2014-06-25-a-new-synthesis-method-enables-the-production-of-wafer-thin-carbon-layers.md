#### Extract
>(Phys.org) â€”Scientists have developed a promising nanomaterial that may be adaptable for use in a wide range of applications. An international team headed by scientists from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) and the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces in Potsdam-Golm has developed an elegant method for producing self-organised carbon nanolayers and equipping them chemically with a range of functions. Such functionalised carbon nanolayers are believed to be suitable for various applications. For example, they could act as coatings that make surfaces both scratchproof and dirt-repellent, or as sensors for the detection of extremely small amounts of substances. The electrical conductivity of carbon layers al...
