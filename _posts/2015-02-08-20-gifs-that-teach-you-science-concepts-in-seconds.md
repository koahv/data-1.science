#### Extract
>There are a number of collections that are like this—collections that aim to demonstrate science concepts in a way that is easily digestable. Each is unique in its own way, and I really encourage you to spend some time google-ing about and finding all the various lists, as many of them are terribly informative.
Here, full disclosure, I tried to trace down the original source.This means that, if the first result that popped up was reddit, I did a reverse image source to trace down the oldest version that I could find. If the oldest source didn&#8217;t explain what was being demonstrated, I cited the source of the gif and found another source to clarify the phenomenon. Apologies that I didn&#8217;t list the first source that I came across as well. Though I may have &#8220;found&#8221; the gif there, well, that just would have been an absurd amount of links, and I thought it might get confusing.
If you want to know more about the people behind FQTQ and what we are about, head here. And I hope you enjoy the show.

&nbsp;
1) This is a a Reuleaux Triangle
(There are curves of constant width besides circles and spheres. It&#8217;s a convex planar shape whose width is the same regardless of the orientation of the curve)
via Strangelove
2) And these Curves of Constant Width can drill square holes
via Imgur
3) This is why Pi is significant
(Animation shows the act of unrolling a circle&#8217;s circumference [or trying to], illustrating the ratio π)
via WikiMedia
4) How to make Pascal’s Triangle
(These are used in algebra and probability, where it can be used to find Combinations. )
via Imagur
5) This is a Miura Fold
(It&#8217;s a method of folding a flat surface into a smaller size. It consists of tessellated parallelograms and is used in the solar panels of satellites)
via Imgur
6) This is a Parabola
(If you kick a soccer ball (or shoot an arrow, fire a missile or throw a stone) it will arc up into the air and come down again&#8230;following the path of a parabola!)
via Mathematics Online
7) This is a Radian
(The radian is the standard unit of angular measure, used in many areas of mathematics)
via WikiMedia
8) This is a Matrix Transposition
(A matrix which is formed by turning all the rows of a given matrix into columns and vice-versa. The transpose of matrix A is written AT )
via WikiMedia
9) This is a Sierpinski Triangle
(a kind of fractal,  a mathematically generated pattern that can be reproducible at any magnification or reduction)
via WikiMedia
10) Here&#8217;s how you convert Cartesian (rectangular) to Polar Coordinates
via WikiMedia
11) This is how Exterior Angles of Polygons work
(they add up to 360 degrees)
via Imgur
12) This is a Hyperboloid made up of straight lines
via Tumbler
13) This is also a Hyperboloid of straight lines
via Tumbler
14) This is how White Blood Cells keep you safe
(in the video, a white blood cell chases and engulfs this bacteria&#8211;watch until the end!)
via YouTube
15) This is Earth’s ice and vegetation cycle over a year
via NASA
16) There is Flammable Matter in Smoke
(it&#8217;s not just nothingness, obviously)
via Imgur
17) This is what it looks like when you set a Flammable Gas on fire in a glass jar
via Imgur
18) This is quantum levitation due to vortex pinning
(A superconductor levitates over a magnetic track)
via YouTube
19) This is how Tension works in relation to falling objects
(watch a slinky fall to the Earth; this is how slinkies always fall)
via YouTube
20) Not all Gasses have the same Density
(Sulphur hexaflouride is much denser than air)
via Pbh2
21) BONUS! And remember, all those amazing astronomy images are much more than 2D images&#8230;
(the Elephant’s Trunk nebula in 3D)
