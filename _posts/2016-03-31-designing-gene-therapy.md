#### Extract
>(European Molecular Biology Laboratory) Scientists in the Barabas group at EMBL have increased the efficiency of a genome-engineering tool called Sleeping Beauty, which is showing promise in clinical trials for leukemia and lymphoma immunotherapies. They made the improvement by determining the 3-D structure of the molecule's active domain, and using that information to design better versions of this tool. In a study published in Nature Communications, they reveal structural information that they hope will ultimately result in better patient outcomes....
