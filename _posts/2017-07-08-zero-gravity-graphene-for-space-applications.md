#### Extract
>Researchers are preparing for two exciting experiments in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) to test the viability of graphene for space applications. The microgravity parabolic flight drop tower experiments will launch between November 6-17, 2017, testing graphene in zero-gravity conditions to determine its potential in space applications including light propulsion and thermal management....
