#### Extract
>Even climate activists increasingly recognise that the lofty rhetoric of the global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, concluded in Paris over a year ago, will not be matched by its promises’ actual impact on temperatures. This should make us think about smart, alternative solutions. But one such alternative, geoengineering, is a solution that many people refuse to entertain. Geoengineering means deliberately manipulating the Earth’s climate. It seems like something from science fiction. But it makes sense to think of it as a prudent and affordable insurance policy. Climate summit after climate summit has failed to affect global temperatures for a simple reason: solar and wind power are still too expensive and inefficient to replace our reliance on fossil fuels. The prevailing approach, embodied by the Paris Agreement, requires governments to try to force immature, uncompetitive green technologies on the world. That’s hugely expensive and inefficient. Engineered reality The...
