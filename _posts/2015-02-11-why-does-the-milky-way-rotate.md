#### Extract
>We live in a galaxy that is called the Milky Way. It's called a barred spiral galaxy, which means that it has a spiral shape with a bar of stars across its middle. The galaxy is rather hugeâ€”at least 100,000 light-years in diameter, making it the second-biggest in our Local Group of galaxies.
