#### Extract
>The world is going green at an unprecedented rate. In 2016, renewable energy accounted for two-thirds of all new power added to the world’s grid, according to a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) — with more solar brought on board than any other technology. Overall, the growth in renewable power is estimated to be twice as large as gas and coal combined over the next five years. According to the report, new solar growth even overtook the net growth in coal, which was previously the largest source of power generation. In many countries, the switch toward solar was propelled by falling prices and more favorable government policies. Now, the agency — which was funded by 28 member governments — predicts that in five years, the global capacity for solar will be greater “than the current combined total power of capacity of India and Japan.” Dr. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said, “What we are witnessing is the birth of a new era in solar photovoltaics [PV].
