#### Extract
>As the world awaits news from Paris about the next international climate deal, some smaller nations are taking big steps toward a future filled with clean and renewable energy that doesnâ€™t contribute to global warming. Last week, Uruguay reported huge gains in clean energy infrastructure that directly translated into cost savings. In less than 10 years, the developing country has reduced its environmental impact and energy costs simultaneously by implementing enough clean energy infrastructure to get 94.5 percent of its energy from renewable sources.   Read the rest of Uruguay now gets almost 95 percent of its energy from renewable sources
