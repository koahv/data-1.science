#### Extract
>(University of Copenhagen - Niels Bohr Institute) The world's most powerful accelerator, the 27 km long Large Hadron Collider operating at CERN in Geneva established collisions between lead nuclei, this morning, at the highest energies ever. The experiments aim at understanding and studying the properties of strongly interacting systems at high densities and thus the state of matter of the Universe shortly after the Big Bang.
