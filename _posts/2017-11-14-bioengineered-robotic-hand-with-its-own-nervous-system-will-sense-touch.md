#### Digest
>The research team is creating a living pathway from the robot's touch sensation to the user's brain to help amputees control the robotic hand. A neuroprosthesis platform will enable them to explore how neurons and behavior can work together to regenerate the sensation of touch in an artificial limb. "By providing a better understanding of how to repair nerve injuries and trauma we will be able to help patients recover motor functionality after an amputation. This research also has broad applications for people who suffer from other forms of neurotrauma such as stroke and spinal cord injuries."

#### Extract
>(Florida Atlantic University) Researchers are developing a first-of-its-kind bioengineered robotic hand that will actually feel and adapt to its environment. This 'living' robot will have its own peripheral nervous system directly linking robotic sensors and actuators....

#### Factsheet
>While highly sophisticated prostheses with complex moving fingers and joints are available to mimic almost every hand motion, they remain frustratingly difficult and unnatural for the user. This is largely because they lack the tactile experience that guides every movement. This void in sensation results in limited use or abandonment of these very expensive artificial devices.
