#### Extract
>(Florida Atlantic University) Researchers are developing a first-of-its-kind bioengineered robotic hand that will actually feel and adapt to its environment. This 'living' robot will have its own peripheral nervous system directly linking robotic sensors and actuators....

#### Factsheet
>While highly sophisticated prostheses with complex moving fingers and joints are available to mimic almost every hand motion, they remain frustratingly difficult and unnatural for the user. This is largely because they lack the tactile experience that guides every movement. This void in sensation results in limited use or abandonment of these very expensive artificial devices.

A neuroprosthesis platform will enable them to explore how neurons and behavior can work together to regenerate the sensation of touch in an artificial limb.
