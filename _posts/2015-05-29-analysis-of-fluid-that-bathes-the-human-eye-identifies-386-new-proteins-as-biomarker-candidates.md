#### Extract
>(Mary Ann Liebert, Inc./Genetic Engineering News) Researchers conducting a comprehensive proteomics analysis of human aqueous humor samples identified 763 proteins -- including 386 proteins detected for the first time -- in this clear fluid that helps maintain pressure in the eye and nourishes the cornea and the lens. These proteins could have a role in disease processes affecting the eye and serve as valuable biomarkers for the development of diagnostics and drug candidates to improve visual health, as discussed in the article 'Proteomics of Human Aqueous Humor,' published in OMICS Journal.
