> Researchers have announced that six boxes of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) will travel to the International Space Station (ISS) to study the impact of weightlessness on the heart. The fruit flies are scheduled to launch on June 1, 2017, from NASAâ€™s Kennedy Space Center and will travel to the ISS via a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.
