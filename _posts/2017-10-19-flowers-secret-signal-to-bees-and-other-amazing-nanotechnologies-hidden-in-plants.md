> Flowers have a secret signal that's specially tailored for bees so they know where to collect nectar. And new research has just given us a greater insight into how this signal works. Nanoscale patterns on the petals reflect light in a way that effectively creates a "blue halo" around the flower that helps attract the bees and encourages pollination.
