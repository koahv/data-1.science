#### Extract
>UTÂ Southwestern Medical Center researchers today published a 3-D atomic structure of the ion channel found in mammals that is implicated in a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disease in humans. The work marks the first such structure determined using the university's $17 million cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) facility that opened last year.
