>What exciting new discoveries await astronomers in the field of gravitational wave astronomy? An aerial view of LIGO Hansford. LIGO / NSF A new-and-improved gravitational wave observatory is open for business. After a five-year-long upgrade, the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (ALIGO) resumed its search for gravitational waves on September 18, 2015. In this first run, its sensitivity is already three times that of the initial LIGO projectâ€™s best run, and eventually it will be running at ten times the sensitivity. When any massive body accelerates through spacetime, it acts like a paddle moving through water, generating ripples known as gravitational waves. The more massive the body and the faster it moves, the...
