#### Extract
>To Transport Antimatter
Like the parents of a newborn baby preparing for the first car trip, particle physicists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) are taking every precaution in preparing to transport antimatter on its first ride.
However, antimatter — the less-understood counterpart to the abundant matter that makes up you, me, and the universe — comes with a unique host of qualities, somewhat different from a baby&#8217;s: like its willingness to explode in response to any contact whatsoever with matter. You can&#8217;t simply put antimatter in a container and throw it in the back of a truck; in fact, any of those steps would spell disaster.
