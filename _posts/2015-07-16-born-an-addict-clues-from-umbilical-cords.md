#### Extract
>Every baby born that enters this world, arrives with an umbilical cord in tow. For those babies born addicted to drugs, that umbilical cord is now a key connection -- a hard to hide clue -- for identifying what drugs are coursing through a newbornâ€™s veins. The drug(s) detected will help physicians determine the best treatment and what withdrawal symptoms to expect.
