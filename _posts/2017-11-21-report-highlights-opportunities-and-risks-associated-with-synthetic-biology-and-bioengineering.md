#### Digest
>Human genome editing, 3D-printed replacement organs and artificial photosynthesis - the field of bioengineering offers great promise for tackling the major challenges that face our society. But as a new article out today highlights, these developments provide both opportunities and risks in the short and long term. Dr Jenny Molloy comments: "One theme that emerged repeatedly was that of inequality of access to the technology and its benefits. The rise of open source, off-patent tools could enable widespread sharing of knowledge within the biological engineering field and increase access to benefits for those in developing countries."

#### Extract
>(University of Cambridge) Human genome editing, 3-D-printed replacement organs and artificial photosynthesis - the field of bioengineering offers great promise for tackling the major challenges that face our society. But as a new article out today highlights, these developments provide both opportunities and risks in the short and long term....

#### Factsheet
>Artificial photosynthesis could improve carbon capture systems and provide sustainable sources of chemicals and fuel. Enhanced photosynthesis could increase yields and address food security. Synthetic gene drives can prevent disease but may be unethical. Human genome editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 could improve human lifespans and health but also poses major ethical dilemmas. In the next five to ten years researchers identified possible emerging technologies such as regenerative medicine - 3D printed body parts and tissue engineering, microbiome based therapies & synthetic biology approaches to microbiota-based therapeutics. The intersection of digital information and organic DNA then expressible in living organisms.
