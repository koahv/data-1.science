#### Extract
>In a new study, researchers show that machine learning algorithms could pick out different types of earthquakes from three years of earthquake recordings at The Geysers in California, a major geothermal energy field. The repeating patterns of earthquakes appear to match the seasonal rise and fall of water-injection flows into the hot rocks below, suggesting a link to the mechanical processes that cause rocks to slip or crack, triggering an earthquake. ...
