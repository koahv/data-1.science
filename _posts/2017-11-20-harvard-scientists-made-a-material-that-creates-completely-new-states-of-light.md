#### Extract
>Light is ubiquitous and vital, but also incredibly strange &#8211; and it&#8217;s possible we&#8217;ll never exhaust the opportunities to learn more about it.
Case in point: researchers at Harvard have developed a material that can generate and maintain completely new and more complex states of light.
The tool uses polarisation to generate structures such as swirling vortices, spirals, and corkscrews that not only help explore light&#8217;s properties, but also have potential practical applications, such as high-powered imaging.
Discoveries about light are still being made. It was only in 2015 that scientists took the first-ever photograph of light behaving as both a particle and a wave.
And it hasn&#8217;t even been that long &#8211; just ...
