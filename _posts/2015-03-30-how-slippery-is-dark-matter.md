#### Extract
>Dozens of galaxy cluster collisions confirm that dark matter particles probably slip right past each other within messy cluster mergers. The existence of dark matter would solve many problems in our universe: it enables spiral galaxies to rotate quickly at their outer edges, keeps galaxy clusters from flying apart, and forms the universeâ€™s cosmic web structure. This collage shows six of the 30 galaxy cluster collisions studied by Harvey and colleagues. They found that dark matter (blue), mapped by gravitational lensing, and galaxies alike slip right past one another. The tenuous X-ray-emitting gas (pink) collides, offsetting it from the dark matter and galaxies. NASA / ESA / STScI / CXC But dark matter, or at least our understanding of it, creates its own set of problems. Simulations show that dark matter pools in gravitational wells, creating galaxies and clusters of galaxies with far denser cores than observed. That pooling happens when dark matter particles are slippery. Weakly inte...
