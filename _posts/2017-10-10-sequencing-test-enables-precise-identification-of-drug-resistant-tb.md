#### Extract
>Two studies document how a new advanced genetic sequencing approach can help thwart the growing worldwide threat posed by drug-resistant mutations of tuberculosis (TB). The threat of TB is increasing in some places as mutant versions of the disease become more and more resistant to current drug treatments.
