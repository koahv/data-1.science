> To the human eye, Mercury may resemble a dull, grey orb but this enhanced-colour image from NASA's Messenger probe, tells a completely different story. Swathes of iridescent blue, sandy-coloured plains and delicate strands of greyish white, create an ethereal and colourful view of our Solar System's innermost planet.
