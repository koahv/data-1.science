#### Extract
>In what could be a breakthrough development for electricity powered aviation, researchers at Siemens have come up with a new kind of electric motor that can delver a continuous output of roughly 260 kilowatts â€“ or about five times the output of other drive systems like it. Phys.org notes that the motor, weighing just over 110 pounds., was specifically designed for use in aircraft and has a record-setting power-to-weight ratio that would power larger aircraft with takeoff weights up to two tons.
