>Investigating inside the human body often requires cutting open a patient or swallowing long tubes with built-in cameras. But what if physicians&nbsp;could get a better glimpse in a&nbsp;less expensive, invasive, and time-consuming manner?





A team from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) led by Professor Dina Katabi is working on doing exactly that with an “in-body GPS" system dubbed&nbsp;ReMix. The new method can pinpoint the location of ingestible implants inside the body using low-power wireless signals. These implants could be used as&nbsp;tiny tracking devices on shifting tumors to help monitor&nbsp;their slight movements.

In animal tests, the team demonstrated that they can track the implants wit...
