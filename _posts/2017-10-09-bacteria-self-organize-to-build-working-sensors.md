#### Extract
>(Duke University) By programming bacteria with a synthetic gene circuit that can recruit gold nanoparticles to the surface of their colony, Duke researchers can build functional devices. A proof-of-concept study appearing in Nature Biotechnology uses this technique to build dome-shaped pressure sensors with the help of living bacteria....
