#### Extract
>Researchers have uncovered new clues to help understand the functions of antisense DNA and its alterations in cancer. Antisense transcripts are DNA sequences that 'rebel,' DNA that are activated in reverse: from right to left. Very little of the function of these is known, but new work provides new clues and mechanisms to understand their functions and their alterations in cancer....
