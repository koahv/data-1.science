#### Extract
>Washington DC (SPX) Jun 24, 2014 Take a fine strand of silica fiber, attach it at each end to a slow-turning motor, gently torture it over an unflickering flame until it just about reaches its melting point and then pull it apart. The middle will thin out like a piece of taffy until it is less than half a micron across - about 200 times thinner than a human hair. That, according to researchers at the Joint Quantum Instit...
