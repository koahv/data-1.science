#### Extract
>Cut and Paste For the first time, doctors have edited the genome of a living human patient. A 44-year-old man received the treatment at a hospital in Oakland, California on November 13. The patient suffers from Hunter syndrome, a rare genetic condition which leaves the sufferer without an enzyme that&#8217;s used to break down complex polysaccharides, a carbohydrate. Left untreated, it can cause permanent damage to mental development, organ function and physical abilities. In this case, doctors have attempted to correct the condition by using zinc finger nucleuses (ZFNs). These enzymes cut a gene that&#8217;s present in liver cells, inserting a functional copy of the gene that produces the desired enzyme. The treatment was developed by Sangamo Therapeutics, a biotechnology firm based in California. “This is the first time someone could have a new gene put into their liver,” said the company&#8217;s president and CEO, Sandy Macrae, in an interview with The Scientist. He described perfo...
