#### Digest
>For the first time, scientists have been able to make edits to the human genome inside a living patient. This process could have a huge impact on our ability to treat diseases like Hunter syndrome. This procedure is part of a larger trial being carried out by Sangamo, which will also consist of experimental treatments for people suffering from hemophilia B and Hurler syndrome, as well as Hunter syndrome. All three diseases are caused by absent or non-functional genes, which can now be inserted thanks to these cutting-edge techniques.



#### Factsheet
>Hunter syndrome is a rare genetic condition which leaves the sufferer without an enzyme that’s used to break down complex polysaccharides, a carbohydrate. Left untreated, it can cause permanent damage to mental development, organ function and physical abilities. Zinc finger nucleuses (ZFNs) are a more unwieldy method of performing gene editing than CRISPR Cas-9, but they do offer more precision. The use of ZFNs to treat Hunter syndrome offers up a huge improvement over the way the disease is addressed at present.
