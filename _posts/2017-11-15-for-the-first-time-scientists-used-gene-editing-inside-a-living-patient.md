#### Digest
>For the first time, scientists have been able to make edits to the human genome inside a living patient. This process could have a huge impact on our ability to treat diseases like Hunter syndrome. This procedure is part of a larger trial being carried out by Sangamo, which will also consist of experimental treatments for people suffering from hemophilia B and Hurler syndrome, as well as Hunter syndrome. All three diseases are caused by absent or non-functional genes, which can now be inserted thanks to these cutting-edge techniques.

#### Extract
>Cut and Paste For the first time, doctors have edited the genome of a living human patient. A 44-year-old man received the treatment at a hospital in Oakland, California on November 13. The patient suffers from Hunter syndrome, a rare genetic condition which leaves the sufferer without an enzyme that&#8217;s used to break down complex polysaccharides, a carbohydrate. Left untreated, it can cause permanent damage to mental development, organ function and physical abilities. In this case, doctors have attempted to correct the condition by using zinc finger nucleuses (ZFNs). These enzymes cut a gene that&#8217;s present in liver cells, inserting a functional copy of the gene that produces the desired enzyme. The treatment was developed by San...

#### Factsheet
>Hunter syndrome is a rare genetic condition which leaves the sufferer without an enzyme thatâ€™s used to break down complex polysaccharides, a carbohydrate. Left untreated, it can cause permanent damage to mental development, organ function and physical abilities. Zinc finger nucleuses (ZFNs) are a more unwieldy method of performing gene editing than CRISPR Cas-9, but they do offer more precision. The use of ZFNs to treat Hunter syndrome offers up a huge improvement over the way the disease is addressed at present.
