> New research could potentially yield a new platform for cancer vaccines. Leveraging a biologically inspired sponge-like gel called 'cryogel' as an injectable biomaterial, the vaccine delivers patient-specific tumor cells together with immune-stimulating biomolecules to enhance the body's attack against cancer.
