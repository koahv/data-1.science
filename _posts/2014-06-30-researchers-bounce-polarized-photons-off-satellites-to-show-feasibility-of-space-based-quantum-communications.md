#### Extract
>(Phys.org) â€”A team of researchers working at the University of Padua in Italy has bounced polarized photons off of four in-flight satellites to show that quantum communications between such satellites and ground based stations is possible. The team has uploaded a paper they've written to the preprint server arXiv, describing their work and what it might mean for future quantum transmissions through space....
