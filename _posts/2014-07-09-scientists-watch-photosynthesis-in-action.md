> (Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY) An international team of scientists, including researchers from DESY, has caught a central step of photosynthesis in action for the first time. The team led by professor Petra Fromme from Arizona State University used the world's most powerful X-ray flashlight at the US National Accelerator Laboratory SLAC to record still frames of a molecular complex called photosystem II as it splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The researchers report their results in the scientific journal Nature.
