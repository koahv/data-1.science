Google&#8217;s chief engineer and notable futurist Ray Kurzweil has said that nanobots or microbots willÂ flow through our bodies by 2030. While the technology could be life-changing, the prospects for these nanobots are still limited by challenges in powering the micro devices and guiding them through the body.
A team of researchers led by Li Zhang, a materials scientist from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in Shatin, may have found a solution to both problems. In a study published in the journal Science Robotics, Zhang and his colleagues turned to a type of miniature alga called Spirulina platensis, commonly used as a dietary supplement.

The key is coating the Spirulina with iron oxide nanoparticles. The helical or spring | tr '
