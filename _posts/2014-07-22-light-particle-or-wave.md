#### Extract
>Classically, light can be thought of in two ways: either as a particle or a wave. But what is it really? Well, the &#8216;observer effect&#8217; makes that question kind of difficult to answer. So before we get too far into it, what is the observer effect? Simply put, the observer effect is a principle that states simply observing (or measuring) something can change its value. This effect is vastly more important in quantum mechanics than in everyday life, though it appears in a great many places. This means that &#8211; like most things in the quantum world &#8211; the phrase “what you see is what you get” doesn’t really apply. Therefore measuring what light is, in a way, can defeat the purpose. However the observer effect does very nicel...
