The announcement comes from Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, which stated that they plan to construct a 5 mile (8 km) track in central California. So although the track won&#8217;t whisk you from New York to the other side of the country (or the globe) in a couple of hours, it is a pretty neat  urban Hyperloop system for local residents. It&#8217;s about time that we took this revolutionary transit system out of the realm of fantasy and made it into a reality—that we turned this science fiction into a scientific reality. In Musk’s design, Hyperloop pods would be mounted on top of thin skis, and air would be the key to the whole system. Air would be pumped into the skis in order to make a kind of &#8220;air cushion.&#8221; This would allow the system to travel without any friction. An electric turbo c...
