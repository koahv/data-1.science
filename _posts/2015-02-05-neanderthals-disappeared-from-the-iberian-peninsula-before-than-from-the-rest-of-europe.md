#### Extract
>(FECYT - Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology) Until a few months ago different scientific articles, including those published in Nature, dated the disappearance of the Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis) from Europe at around 40,000 years ago. However, a new study shows that these hominids could have disappeared before then in the Iberian Peninsula, closer to 45,000 years ago.
