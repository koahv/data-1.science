#### Extract
>(Phys.org)â€”Genome editing for purposes of replication and repair is handled by enzymes called endonucleases, which cleave DNA strands at very specific sites. These are called "restriction sites," composed of palendromic sequences of nucleotides. The repair of broken DNA forks is not fully understood; among other things, scientists would like to determine how break-induced replication (BIR), a genome rearrangement-repair mechanism, avoids destabilization of the genome that leads to rapid evolution, adaptation and tumorigenesis....
