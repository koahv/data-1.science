> (Faculty of Science - University of Copenhagen) Danish researchers, in collaboration with researchers in the United States and Britain, have studied the DNA of Greenlanders whose Inuit forefathers have been living in the Arctic for tens of thousands of years. The Arctic is an extreme environment, characterized by a cold climate and sparse vegetation, an environment that has forced the Inuit to adapt. Their success at doing so is reflected in their genetic material.
