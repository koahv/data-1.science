#### Extract
>Researchers have uncovered the first evidence of an unusual quantum phenomenon -- the integer quantum Hall effect -- in a new type of film, called a 3-D topological insulator. This discovery could help move science forward toward the goal of dissipationless electronics -- electronic devices that can operate without producing the vast amounts of heat generated by current silicon-based semiconductors....
