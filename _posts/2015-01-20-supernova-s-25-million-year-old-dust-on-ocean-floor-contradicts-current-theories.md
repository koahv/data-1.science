They have analysed extraterrestrial dust thought to be from supernovae, that has settled on ocean floors to determine the amount of heavy elements created by the massive explosions. "Small amounts of debris from these distant explosions fall on the earth as it travels through the galaxy," said lead researcher Anton Wallner, from the Research School of Physics and Engineering at The Australian National University (ANU). "We've analysed galactic dust from the last 25 million years that has settled on the ocean and found there is much less of the heavy elements su...
