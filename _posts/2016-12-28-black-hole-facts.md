#### Extract
>Learn black hole facts, such as what we mean by “singularity” and “ergosphere,” and why we think black holes are real. You can think of a spinning black hole as a cosmic whirlpool. Harry Clarke, from Edgar Allan Poe's story "Descent into the Maelstrom" (1919) What is a black hole? A black hole is a pit in the fabric of spacetime. Space and time, according to Einstein’s theory of special relativity, are interchangeable parts, or dimensions, of spacetime, much as width, height, and depth are dimensions of a box. Einstein’s theory is sometimes blamed for “making everything relative,” because it says the dimensions of space and time aren’t absolutes and can change, contracting or dilating depending on your frame of reference — effects only noticeable when dealing with strong gravity or relativistic speeds. However, that accusation is misleading, because units of spacetime are absolute. In this wacky landscape, a black hole is a cosmic pothole. Black holes are places where the density of m...
