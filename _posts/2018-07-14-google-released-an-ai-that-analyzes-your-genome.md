>Genome Analysis
In the 15 years since the human genome was first sequenced in a historic scientific achievement, genomic sequencing has become relatively routine, with huge genomes being sequenced at incredible speeds. However, sorting through nucleotides and making educated guesses about their use can only get us so far. On December 4, Google released a tool that may help: DeepVariant, which utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and machine learning to more accurately build a picture of a person&#8217;s genome from sequencing data.
Machine learning is an application of AI that allows systems to improve without external programming or interference. By automatically identifying small insertion and deletion mutations and single bas...
