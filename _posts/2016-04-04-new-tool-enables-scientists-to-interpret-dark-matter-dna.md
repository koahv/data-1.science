> Scientists have invented a new way to read and interpret the human genome. The computational method, called TargetFinder, can predict where non-coding DNA -- the DNA that does not code for proteins -- interacts with genes. This technology helps researchers connect mutations in the so-called genomic 'dark matter' with the genes they affect, potentially revealing new therapeutic targets for genetic disorders.
