#### Extract
>By tracking deviations in spacecraft orbits, planetary scientists have created a high-resolution map of the Red Planet's gravitational pull.
If you could see past Mars’s surface to how its gravity changes from place to place, what you’d see is this:
This map shows local variations in Mars's gravitational pull on orbiters. The view is centered at 90 degrees west longitude, showing the four volcanoes of the Tharsis region (white dots) and the deep Valles Marineris canyon system just right of center (dark blue gash). The color coding is in units of gravity acceleration variability, called gals or galileos. The range is from about half a negative gal (dark blue) to one positive gal (white).
