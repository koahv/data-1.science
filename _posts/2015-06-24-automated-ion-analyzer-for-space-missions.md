#### Extract
>The German Aerospace Center (DLR) is scheduled to launch its Eu:CROPIS research satellite into orbit in early 2017. Its purpose is to test a biological life-support system for future human space missions.

The satellite’s payload includes an ion analyzer developed by Fraunhofer. This compact device will automatically monitor all of the system’s internal processes. The scientists will present the analyzer at ACHEMA 2015 from June 15 to 19 (Hall 9.2, Booth D64).Read more about Automated Ion Analyzer for Space MissionsComments
