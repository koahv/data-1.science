#### Extract
>A team of researchers led by Dr. Stefano Bovino at the Institute for Astrophysics GÃ¶ttingen (IAG) has conducted high-resolution simulations investigating the formation of the oldest-known star in our galaxy, SMSS J031300.36-670839.3, on a supercomputer of the North-German Supercomputing Alliance. Using the star's abundance patterns, the scientists have performed cosmological simulations which include the dynamics of gas and dark matter as well as the chemical evolution. From this simulation, the scientists expect to obtain an improved understanding of the transition from the first to the second generation of stars in the universe. The results of their study were published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters....
