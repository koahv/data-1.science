#### Extract
>Designing new molecules for pharmaceuticals is primarily a manual, time-consuming process that’s prone to error. But MIT researchers have now taken a step toward fully automating the design process, which could drastically speed things up — and produce better results.



Drug discovery relies on lead optimization. In this process, chemists select a target (“lead”) molecule with known potential to interact with a specific biological target, then tweak its chemical properties for higher potency and other factors.



Chemists use expert knowledge and conduct manual tweaking of the structure of molecules, adding and subtracting functional groups — groups of atoms and bonds with specific properties. Even when they use systems that predict optima...
