#### Extract
>The composition and radiative effect of desert aerosols have been analyzed by researchers. Results show that the intrusion of dust from the Sahara Desert caused radiative cooling of the Earth's surface. There is no doubt that research into atmospheric aerosols is becoming increasingly important due to the effects that they can have on the global temperature of the Earth, given that solar radiation is the main source of energy for the Earth-Atmosphere system, scientists explain....
