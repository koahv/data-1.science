#### Extract
>(Phys.org) —It's the most powerful accelerator-based neutrino experiment ever built in the United States, and the longest-distance one in the world. It's called NOvA, and after nearly five years of construction, scientists are now using the two massive detectors – placed 500 miles apart – to study one of nature's most elusive subatomic particles.
