#### Extract
>(Phys.org) â€”A team of researchers with members from Germany and Egypt has found that red fluorescence as found in many species of fish appears to be for visual purposes, rather than as a UV protection mechanism. In their paper published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, the team describes how they captured and tested several species of fish with red fluorescence and found that those that lived in deeper water had more fluorescence, not less, than those that lived in more shallow water.
