#### Extract
>Gravity is a fundamental force of physics, one which we Earthlings tend to take for granted. You can't really blame us. Having evolved over the course of billions of years in Earth's environment, we are used to living with the pull of a steady 1 g (or 9.8 m/s2). However, for those who have gone into space or set foot on the Moon, gravity is a very tenuous and precious thing.
