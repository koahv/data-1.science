> (University of Massachusetts at Amherst) Briseno's research group is one of very few in the world to design and grow organic single-crystal p-n junctions. He says, 'This work is a major advancement in the field of organic solar cells because we have developed what the field considers the 'Holy Grail' architecture for harvesting light and converting it to electricity.' The breakthrough in morphology control should have widespread use in solar cells, batteries and vertical transistors, he adds.
