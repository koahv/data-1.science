#### Extract
>Cassini radar observations reveal a channel system on Saturn’s biggest moon, Titan, that is drowned in liquid methane. Ligeia Mare is the second largest sea on Saturn's moon Titan -- the only moon in the solar system with a sizable atmosphere. Snaking up from the top of the sea's right-hand "lobe" is Vid Flumina, a Nile-scale river feature. A new analysis of Cassini observations reveals that several channels in Vid Flumina's dendritic system are steep canyons with liquid at their bottoms.NASA / JPL-Caltech / ASI / Cornell The Saturnian moon Titan looks a lot like Earth. Seas, deltas, dunes — even hints of fog and rain. Except, it’s so cold on Titan that water is rock-hard ice; the liquid here is made of hydrocarbons, particularly methane. Planetary scientists know that the seas on Titan are filled with methane, ethane, and perhaps other, similar compounds. They’ve also seen sinuous, river-looking channels that extend for hundreds of kilometers across the moon. One drainage network in p...
