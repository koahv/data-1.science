>Cassini radar observations reveal a channel system on Saturn’s biggest moon, Titan, that is drowned in liquid methane. Ligeia Mare is the second largest sea on Saturn's moon Titan -- the only moon in the solar system with a sizable atmosphere. Snaking up from the top of the sea's right-hand "lobe" is Vid Flumina, a Nile-scale river feature. A new analysis of Cassini observations reveals that several channels in Vid Flumina's dendritic system are steep canyons with liquid at their bottoms.NASA / JPL-Caltech / ASI / Cornell The Saturnian moon Titan looks a lot like Earth. Seas, deltas, dunes — even hints of fog and rain. Except, it’s so cold on Titan that water is rock-hard ice; the liquid here is made of hydrocarbons, particularly methane. P...
