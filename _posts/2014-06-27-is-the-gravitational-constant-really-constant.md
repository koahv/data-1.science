>Image Credit: How Stuff Works Throughout the universe, there are several underlying principles that we consider to be constants; for example, the speed of light in a vacuum. So many different aspects of our understanding of the universe comes from this one constant. If the speed of light wasn&#8217;t constant, GPS systems wouldn&#8217;t work, and we wouldn&#8217;t be able to determine the age of distant galaxies in the universe. Most of Einstein&#8217;s equations would fall apart without a constant speed of light; time dilation and , the mass-energy relationship would fluctuate and quantum fluctuations on the Plank scale could potentially have large scale effects. The speed of light in a vacuum is considered to be constant, never changing...
