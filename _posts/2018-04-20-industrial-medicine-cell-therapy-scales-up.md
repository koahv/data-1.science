#### Extract
>In October, scientists in Boston revealed they’d used genetically modified cells to cure 15 boys of a nerve disease that until now has been nearly 100 percent fatal. During a clinical trial, which lasted two years, doctors used experimental gene therapy to treat the boys with their own engineered cells. When the results came in, 15 of the 17 boys had no remaining disabilities.
Cell therapy is a new way to treat serious diseases like cancer by extracting living cells from a donor or a patient, changing them so they can recognize and attack diseased cells or deliver treatment, and returning them to the patient&#8217;s body. But manufacturing the cells is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. A single dose can cost hundreds of thousands of dol...
