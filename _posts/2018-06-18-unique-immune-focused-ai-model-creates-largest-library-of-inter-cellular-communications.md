#### Extract
>(CytoReason) New data published in Nature Biotech, represents the largest ever analysis of immune cell signaling research, mapping more than 3,000 previously unlisted cellular interactions, and yielding the first ever immune-centric modular classification of diseases. These data serve to rewrite the reference book on immune-focused inter-cellular communications and disease relationships.New Data Published by Nature Biotechnology: Covering 16,000,000 scientific articles, this massive Natural Language Processing (NLP) project quadruples the reference body of organized inter-cellular signalling interactions, plots inter-cellular immune profiles for 188 diseases and creates the first ever immune-centered map of disease similarities and differen | tr '
