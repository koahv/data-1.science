Mars is a microcosm -a spiritual jumping off place in our exploration of the Universe. The white spaces -the unmapped, unexplored, unknown white spaces of the map of Planet Earth no longer exist. Our 21st Century explorers look to Mars and the planets of our Solar System and beyond for the challenge of the unexplored, the unknown.
The image above is the  first true-color image of Mars from ESA’s Rosetta generated using the OSIRIS orange (red), green and blue color filters. The image was acquired on 24 February 2007 at 19:28 CET from a distance of about 240,000 kilometers.
Regional dust storm activities over Northern Hemisphere of Mars shown below- captured by Mars Color Camera on-board Mars Orbiter Spacecraft from altitude of 74500 km on Sep 28, 2014.  India's Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted-off from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre on 5 November 2013. After a 298-day transit to Mars, it was successfully inserted into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014.
 

 
Mars 3-D anaglyph (black &amp; white) below was taken by ESA’s Rosetta spacecraft during Mars flyby on 24 February 2007 from a distance of about 240,000 km. Image resolution is about 5 km.
