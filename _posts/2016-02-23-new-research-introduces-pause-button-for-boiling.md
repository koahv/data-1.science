#### Extract
>(Syracuse University) Using a focused laser beam to essentially hit the pause button on boiling, Professor Shalabh Maroo's research group and collaborators at NIST and RPI have created a single vapor bubble in a pool of liquid that can remain stable on a heated surface for hours, instead of milliseconds. This method gives researchers time to study vapor bubbles and determine ways to optimize the boiling process....
