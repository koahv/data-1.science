#### Extract
>Researchers at UC Berkeley managed to generate the map with the help of a US department of energy supercomputer, showing how the hot molten rock doesn’t rise up in a straight line. Also, the base of the island may not be directly beneath it. Rather, the plumes – which are 400-degrees hotter than surrounding rock, and are far wider below the surface than geophysicists had presumed – rise haphazardly and then widen as they get to the surface. The latter aspect is what shapes volcanic islands, like Hawaii, with the lower rock often not directly connected to what we consider islands, thanks to a meandering rise. The research actually shows two huge, 5,000km-across “blobs” of hot rock, directly opposite each other under Africa and the Pacific O...
