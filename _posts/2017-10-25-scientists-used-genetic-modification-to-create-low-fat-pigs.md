#### Extract
>Low-Fat Pigs Chinese scientists have successfully used CRISPR to create twelve healthy pigs that have around 24 percent less body fat than normal. The genetically modified low-fat pigs are still capable of maintaining a healthy body temperature, which could allow farmers to ensure the animals&#8217; welfare without spending as much money on feeding them and keeping them warm. Most mammals possess a gene known as UCP1, which allows an organisms to regulate its body temperature when it&#8217;s cold by burning fatâ€“but pigs don&#8217;t. The scientists took the gene from a mouse and used CRISPR to introduce it into pig cells. These cells were used to create in excess of 2,553 cloned pig embryos. Embryos were then implanted into thirteen pigs, t...
