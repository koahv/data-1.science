> (University of North Carolina Health Care) When common chemotherapy drugs  hit cancer cells, they damage DNA so that the cells can't replicate. But the cells have ways to repair the DNA, and the drugs aren't effective enough. UNC researchers created a way to find where this DNA repair happens throughout all of human DNA. The finding offers scientists a route to target the proteins cancer cells use to circumnavigate therapy. The benefit could be more effective and better cancer therapeutics.
