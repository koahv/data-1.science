> When cataracts encroach on the eyes, the only effective remedy is to surgically replace the eyes' lenses with synthetic substitutes. But what if scientists found a way to delay or prevent cataracts from forming in the first place? Researchers may have found such an opportunity by identifying the prime suspects in the formation of cataracts -- deficiency of two genes that encode regulatory proteins.
