#### Extract
>Scientists working at GE labs in upstate New York have spent decades building computer vision systems that can study diseased tissue, and hunt for microscopic cracks in machine parts and other features often invisible to the naked eye. “Computer vision can be used to find things we either can’t see or may not know to look for,” says Joseph Vinciquerra, who runs the Additive Research Lab at GE Global Research in Niskayuna, New York. Now Vinciquerra and his team are using their insights to improve the way 3D printers work. Even though companies like GE already print parts for jet engines, additive manufacturing is still a young field. It can take days to weeks to print large parts such as a compressor blade. If something goes wrong near the end of the process, precious machine time and money could go to waste. The GE researchers are building a system that could speed up the process and eventually achieve “100 percent yield,” an engineer’s Nirvana where machines only produce good parts, b...
