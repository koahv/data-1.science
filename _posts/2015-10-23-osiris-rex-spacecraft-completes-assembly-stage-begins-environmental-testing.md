> (University of Arizona) NASA's Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft has begun environmental testing at Lockheed Martin Space Systems facilities, near Denver, Colorado. OSIRIS-REx, led by the University of Arizona, will be the first US mission to return samples from an asteroid to Earth for further study.
