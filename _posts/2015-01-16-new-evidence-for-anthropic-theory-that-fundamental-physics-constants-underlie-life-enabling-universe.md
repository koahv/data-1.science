#### Extract
>(Science China Press) For decades, physicists have been uncovering evidence that the fundamental physics parameters of this universe seem precisely tuned to allow the emergence of stars, galaxies, planets and carbon-based life. In a new study, Bonn-based theoretical physicist Ulf-G MeiÃŸner uses computer simulations to test the degrees of variance of certain parameters in the Standard Model of Particle Physics that still result in a life-enabling universe rich with water and oxygen, or in a hypothesized lifeless universe....
