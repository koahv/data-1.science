#### Extract
>(Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution) For more than a decade, the scientific community has postulated that methane could be spontaneously produced by chemical reactions between hydrogen from hydrothermal vent fluid and carbon dioxide. New research by geochemists at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is the first to show that methane formation does not occur during the relatively quick fluid circulation process, despite extraordinarily high hydrogen contents in the waters....
