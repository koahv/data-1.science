#### Extract
>Drug discovery is the process of identifying molecular compounds that are likely to become the active ingredient in prescription medicine. At a high level, it works by taking a set of candidate compounds (either synthetic or naturally derived) and evaluating their chemical reactions with (an often cloned) molecule that is largely correlated with a particular disease. Machine learning, and deep learning, in particular, have been highly successful in predicting the chemical reactions between candidate compounds and target molecules (see some examples&nbsp;here, here, and here). These models have enabled biomedical engineers to rapidly iterate on the design of new synthetic compounds by querying a trained deep neural network to estimate how a ...
