#### Extract
>(Osaka University) The Institute of Laser Engineering, Osaka University, has succeeded to reinforce the Petawatt 3 laser 'LFEX' to deliver up to 2,000 trillion watts in the duration of one-trillionth of one second. This corresponds to 1,000 times the integrated electric power consumed in the world. By using this high-power laser, it is now possible to generate all of the high-energy quantum beams (electrons, ions, gamma ray, neutron, positron)....
