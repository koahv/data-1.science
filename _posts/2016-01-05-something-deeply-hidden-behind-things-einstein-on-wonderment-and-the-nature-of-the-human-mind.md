#### Extract
>How a simple compass oriented one of humanity&#8217;s greatest minds toward the truth of things.

&#8220;Behind the cotton wool is hidden a pattern,&#8221; Virginia Woolf wrote in her breathtaking recollection of the insight that made her an artist. &#8220;The whole world is a work of art… there is no Shakespeare… no Beethoven… no God; we are the words; we are the music; we are the thing itself.&#8221; 
In 1946, five years after Woolf&#8217;s death, another one of humanity&#8217;s most luminous and expansive minds recounted arriving at a strikingly similar notion via a strikingly similar formative experience. 

In a passage from his Autobiographical Notes (public library), sixty-seven-year-old Albert Einstein (March 14, 1879&ndash;April 18, 1955) considers the nature of wonderment:
I have no doubt that our thinking goes on for the most part without use of signs (words) and beyond that to a considerable degree unconsciously. For how, otherwise, should it happen that we sometimes &#8220;wonder&#8221; quite spontaneously about some experience? This &#8220;wondering&#8221; appears to occur when an experience comes into conflict with a world of concepts already sufficiently fixed within us. Whenever such a conflict is experienced sharply and intensely it reacts back upon our world of thought in a decisive way. The development of this world of thought is in a certain sense a continuous flight from &#8220;wonder.&#8221; 
A wonder of this kind I experienced as a child of four or five years when my father showed me a compass. That this needle behaved in such a determined way did not at all fit in the kind of occurrences that could find a place in the unconscious world of concepts (efficacy produced by direct “touch”). I can still remember &#8212; or at least believe I can remember &#8212; that this experience made a deep and lasting impression upon me. Something deeply hidden had to be behind things.
Complement Autobiographical Notes, a revelatory read in its slim but potent entirety, with Einstein on kindness, the secret to learning anything, the common language of science, his exquisite love letters, and this lovely picture-book biography of the great scientist.
