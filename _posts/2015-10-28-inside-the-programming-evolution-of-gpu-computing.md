#### Extract
>Back in 2000, Ian Buck and a small computer graphics team at Stanford University were watching the steady evolution of computer graphics processors for gaming and thinking about how such devices could be extended to fit a wider class of applications. At first, the connection was not clear, but as GPUs started to become programmable to enable more realistic game graphics, Buck and his team started tweaking the small devices, playing with the relatively small bit of programmability to test the limits of possible performance outside of game graphics. â€œAt the time, a lot of the GPU development was driven &#8230; Inside The Programming Evolution of GPU Computing was written by Nicole Hemsoth at The Platform....
