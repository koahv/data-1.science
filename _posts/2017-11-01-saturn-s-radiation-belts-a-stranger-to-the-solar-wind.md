>Within radiation belts, very energetic particles, such as electrons and protons, move around the planet at high velocities - captured by its magnetic field. In the case of the Earth, the solar wind, a current of charged particles from the Sun varying in strength, controls the intensity of the radiation belt both directly and indirectly. The radiation belts of Saturn, however, develop completely independently of the solar wind and are instead decisively influenced by the gas giant's moons. The activity of the Sun – and with it the strength of the solar wind – follows an eleven-year cycle. Saturn's proton radiation belts are gigantic: they reach from the planet's innermost ring to the orbit of the moon Tethys – and thus more than 285,000 kilometers into space. A decisive difference to Earth: while our moon is located far beyond the limits of the magnetosphere and the radiation belts, Saturn's radiation belts contain several of its satellites, such as the large moons Janus, Mimas, and Enceladus. On Earth, the high-energy particles that form the radiation belts have two origins. Some are provided directly by the solar wind. Others result from incident protons of extreme energy originating from our Galaxy, called Galactic Cosmic Rays. When Galactic Cosmic Rays reach the planet's atmosphere, it sets in motion a chain of reactions, at the end of which high-energy electrons and protons are created. Since the solar wind partially shields and thus modulates this cosmic radiation, the Sun's activity also plays a decisive role in this process.  "We observe that the intensity drop in the proton radiation belts of Saturn coincides exactly with strong changes in the EUV radiation from the Sun," Roussos describes. It is therefore possible that while the solar wind has no impact on the radiation belts, the Sun still may.
