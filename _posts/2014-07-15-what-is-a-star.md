/> EIT - SOHO Consortium, ESA, NASAA star is a luminous ball of gas, mostly hydrogen and helium, held together by its own gravity. Nuclear fusion reactions in its core support the star against gravity and produce photons and heat, as well as small amounts of heavier elements. The Sun is the closest star to Earth.According to current star formation theory, stars are born as clumps within gigantic gas clouds that collapse in on themselves. The cloud’s material heats up as it falls inward under the force of its own gravity. When the gas reaches about 10 million K (18 million degrees F), hydrogen nuclei begin to fuse into helium nuclei, and the star is born. Energy from nuclear fusion radiates outward from the center of the burgeoning star, and gradually halts the gas cloud’s collapse.<div

The most massive (and hottest) stars exhaust their energy supply within a few million years, while tiny and cool red dwarf stars can keep on burning for many billions of years.The post <a
