#### Extract
>(BGI Shenzhen) An international team, led by researchers from BGI and University of California, presented their latest significant finding that the altitude adaptation in Tibet might be caused by the introgression of DNA from extinct Denisovans or Denisovan-related individuals into humans. This work published online in Nature sheds new light into understanding human's adaptation to diverse environments including temperature extremes, new pathogens, and high altitude. Other important collaborators of this study include the scientists from The People's Hospital of Lhasa, South China University of Technology, among others....
