> Dark matter is a mysterious type of matter that doesn't interact with any form of electromagnetic radiation, i.e., light. It doesn’t radiate light, and light doesn’t bounce off it. Although we’ve never detected dark matter directly, a large amount of evidence points to its existence.Evidence for Dark MatterFritz Zwicky first proposed the idea in the 1930s, when he was observing the nearby and populous Coma galaxy cluster. By observing the light these galaxies emitted, Zwicky estimated the total mass of the cluster. But when he measured the galaxies’ velocities, Zwicky discovered that they were moving so fast that the cluster should have been breaking apart: the gravitational pull of its mass was too small in comparison.It seemed unlikely that Zwicky had caught this cluster in the act of coming apart. Instead, something other than the galaxies’ observable matter was contributing significantly to the total mass of the cluster and holding it together. Zwicky suggested that there must be some kind of unseen matter at work here: matter that produced observable gravitational effects, but did not radiate like normal matter.Further evidence for dark matter came from individual galaxies’ rotation curves, plots that compare the velocities at which stars orbit around their galaxies’ centers with the stars’ distances from the galactic center. The stars on the outskirts orbit so fast, they shouldn’t be bound to the galaxies — but they are. If our understanding of gravity is correct, these stars’ velocities can only be explained if there is an unobserved source of mass in the galactic halo.<div                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 +
