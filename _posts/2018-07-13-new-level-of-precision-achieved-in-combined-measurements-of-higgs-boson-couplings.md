#### Extract
>The Higgs boson, discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012, has a singular role in the Standard Model of particle physics. Most notable is the Higgs boson's affinity to mass, which can be likened to the electric charge for an electric field: the larger the mass of a fundamental particle, the larger the strength of its interaction, or "coupling," with the Higgs boson. Deviations from these predictions could be a hallmark of new physics in this as-yet little-explored part of the Standard Model....
