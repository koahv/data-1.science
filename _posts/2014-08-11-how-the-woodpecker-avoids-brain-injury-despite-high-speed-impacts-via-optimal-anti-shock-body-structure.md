#### Extract
>(Science China Press) Researchers worldwide recognize the woodpecker's body functions as an excellent anti-shock organism; its brain can bear deceleration of 1,200 g during rapid pecking. This relates to its unique morphology and ability to absorb impact energy. Using computed tomography and the construction of high-precision 3-D models of the woodpecker, Chinese scientists explain its anti-shock biomechanical structure in terms of energy distribution and conversion. These findings could guide the design of anti-shock devices and structures for humans....
