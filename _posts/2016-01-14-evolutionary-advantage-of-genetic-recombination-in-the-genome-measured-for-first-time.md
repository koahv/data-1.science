> (Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona) Researchers from the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona, in collaboration with researchers in the universities of Sussex and Edinburgh, have quantified one of the most important and hard-to-measure phenomena in molecular evolution: the effect of genetic recombination on a species' capacity of adaptation.
