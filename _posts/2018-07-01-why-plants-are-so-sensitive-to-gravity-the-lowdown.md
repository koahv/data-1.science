#### Extract
>Plants can detect the slightest angle of inclination. Yet the mechanism by which they sense gravity relies on microscopic grains. In theory, such a system should hardly allow for precise detection of inclination. Researchers from the CNRS, the French National Institute of Agronomic Research (INRA), and Universit√© Clermont Auvergne have now explained this curious paradox: The grains are constantly being agitated within the plant cells....
