> Human stem cells can be differentiated to produce other cell types, such as organ cells, skin cells, or brain cells. While organ cells, for example, can function in isolation, brain cells require synapses, or connectors, between cells and between regions of the brain. Researchers now report successfully growing multiple brain structures and forming connections between them in vitro, in a single culture vessel, for the first time.
