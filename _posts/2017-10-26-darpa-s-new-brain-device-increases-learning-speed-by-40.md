#### Extract
>Cheap and Non-Invasive New research funded by the U.S. Department of Defense&#8217;s Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) has successfully demonstrated how a non-invasive method of stimulating the brain can boost cognitive performance. Working under DARPA&#8217;s Restoring Active Memory (RAM) program, scientists from HRL Laboratories in California, McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and Soterix Medical in New York tested their brain device on macaques and observed a substantial increase in the monkeys&#8217; ability to quickly perform certain tasks.
