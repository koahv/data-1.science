#### Digest
>Research by an OU molecular physicist has discovered that electrons can control chemical reactions in experiments leading to purer, cheaper chemical products. Electrons displaying their own quantum mechanical nature (ie its state, such as its momentum and position), can induce coherence in other molecules. Observing these low energy electrons, physicists from both The Open University and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, have discovered that chemical reactions can be controlled using electrons – rather than lasers, which are currently used – providing a much cheaper alternative to controlling chemical reactions. This has applications in the manufacturing of new chemical products that can be used in industry, including new drugs for cancer therapy and new electronics for computers.
