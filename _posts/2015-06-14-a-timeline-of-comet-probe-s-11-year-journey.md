> The European Space Agency said Sunday that its comet lander Philae has woken up from hibernation and managed to send data back to Earth for the first time in seven months. The probe went quiet on Nov. 15, three days after it was separated from its mother ship Rosetta and touched down on the city surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
