#### Extract
>NIMS and Tohoku University have jointly observed an anisotropic magneto-Peltier effectâ€”a thermoelectric conversion phenomenon in which simple redirection of a charge current in a magnetic material induces heating and cooling. Thermoelectric heating and cooling are conventionally achieved by applying a charge current to a junction between two different electrical conductors. In this study, the researchers demonstrated a novel thermal control function using a single magnetic material without relying on a junction structure. Although the anisotropic magneto-Peltier effect is a fundamental thermoelectric conversion phenomenon, it has never before been observed....
