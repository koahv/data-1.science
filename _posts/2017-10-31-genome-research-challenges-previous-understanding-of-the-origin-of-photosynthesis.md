>It is thought that anoxygenic photosynthesis evolved before oxygenic photosynthesis, playing a role in some of the earliest evidence for life on Earth, before the rise of atmospheric oxygen. Using a combination of comparative genomics and molecular clock analyses, researchers determined that phototrophic members of the Chloroflexi phylum evolved far too recently to have been the progenitors of oxygenic photosynthesis, a process that evolved about 2.3 billion years ago. In contrast, it was found that Chloroflexi did not predate the process at all, having evolved roughly 867 million years ago.
