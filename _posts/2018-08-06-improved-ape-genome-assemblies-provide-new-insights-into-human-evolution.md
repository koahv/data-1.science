#### Extract
>Higher-quality assemblies of great ape genomes have now been generated without guidance of the human reference genome. They provide a clearer view of genetic differences that arose as humans diverged from other primates. The newest investigation offers the most comprehensive catalog of genetic variants that were gained or lost in different ape lineages. The influence of these variants was explored in brain development, dietary needs and anatomy. A fossil virus found in ape but not human genomes was also examined. ...
