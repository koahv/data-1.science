#### Extract
>State-of-the-art quantum devices are not yet large enough to be called full-scale computers. The biggest comprise just a few dozen qubitsâ€”a meager count compared to the billions of bits in an ordinary computer's memory. But steady progress means that these machines now routinely string together 10 or 20 qubits and may soon hold sway over 100 or more....
