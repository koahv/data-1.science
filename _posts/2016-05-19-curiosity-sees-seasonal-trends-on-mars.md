#### Extract
>During two Martian years, Curiosity tracks seasonal patterns in local atmosphere, temperature, and maybe even methane.  Curiosity measured seasonal patterns that show the local atmosphere is clear in winter, dustier in spring and summer, and windy in autumn. The visibility in Gale Crater is as low as 20 miles (30km) in summer and as high as 80 miles (130km) in winter. NASA / JPL-Caltech / MSSS Last week, Curiosity completed its second Martian year, even though it landed in Gale Crater almost four years ago. Mars is much further from the Sun than Earth is, so the Red Planet takes nearly twice as long to complete one orbit around our star: 687 days to our planet’s 365 days. For the past two Martian years, Curiosity has been busy collecting rock samples. Those have revealed that this part of Mars was once habitable. But the rover has also been measuring atmospheric pressure, temperature, and methane levels. These measurements show seasonal changes, much like Earth’s yearly rhythm. Seasons...
