Very cold liquid water also flowed through its rivers and lakes on the lower-lying areas, forming landscapes similar to those which can be found in Iceland or Alaska. "It is even possible that the area of impact was already covered by glaciers before the collision, and in that case the glaciers would have re-covered the recently formed crater in a very short time," says the lead investigator of the study Alberto Fairén, from the Centro de Astrobiología (INTA-CSIC) in Spain and Co...
