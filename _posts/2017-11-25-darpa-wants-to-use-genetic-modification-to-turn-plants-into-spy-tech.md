#### Extract
>Mother Nature Knows Best
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the think-tank that&#8217;s under the U.S. Department of Defense, recently announced that it&#8217;s working on a new project that could change how pertinent information is gathered on the battlefield. The project, dubbed the Advanced Plant Technologies (APT) program, examines the possibility of turning plants into next-generation surveillance technology.
&#8220;The program will pursue technologies to engineer robust, plant-based sensors that are self-sustaining in their environment and can be remotely monitored using existing hardware,&#8221; the agency said in a press announcement. The APT&#8217;s goal is to boost the natural stimulus-response mechanisms in pl | tr '
