> (Karlsruher Institut für Technologie (KIT) ) The first all-optical permanent on-chip memory has been developed by scientists of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and the universities of Münster, Oxford, and Exeter. This is an important step on the way towards optical computers. Phase change materials that change their optical properties depending on the arrangement of the atoms allow for the storage of several bits in a single cell. The researchers present their development in the journal Nature Photonics.
