Or did the water originate even earlier—in the cold, ancient molecular cloud that spawned the sun and that planet-forming disk? Up to half of the water on Earth is likely older than the solar system itself, University of Michigan astronomers theorize. The researchers' work helps to settle a debate about just how far back in galactic history our planet and our solar system's water formed. Between 30 and 50 percent came from the molecular cloud, says Ilse Cleeves, a doctoral student in astronomy at University of Michigan. That would make it roughly a million...
