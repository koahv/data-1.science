But for Earth-observing satellites, the Moon serves as a crucial calibration source — and it's about to get an overhaul. The Moon doesn't produce its own light, of course: Its surface reflects the light of the Sun. But even though the Moon is airless and practically unchanging, not every lunar reflection is the same.
