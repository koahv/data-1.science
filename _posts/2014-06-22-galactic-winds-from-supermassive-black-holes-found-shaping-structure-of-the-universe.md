An international team of scientists have discovered that winds blowing from a supermassive black hole in a nearby galaxy work to obscure observations and x-rays. The discovery sheds light on the unexpected behavior of black holes, which emit large amounts of matter through powerful, galactic winds. Using a large array of satellites and space observatories, the team spent more than a year training their instruments on the brightest and most studied of the "local" black holes — the one situated at the core of Type I Seyfert Galaxy NGC 5548. "Shadowing" of light from a black hole had not been seen before. With the discovery, scientists were able to decipher the outflow.
"These outflows are thought to be a major player in the structure...
