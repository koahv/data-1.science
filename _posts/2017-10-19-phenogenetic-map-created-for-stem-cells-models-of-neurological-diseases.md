#### Extract
>In an effort to better understand neurological diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and ALS -- and develop new ways to treat them -- researchers have performed the first meta-analysis of all induced pluripotent stem cell models for neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, and created an atlas of how cell characteristics are linked to their genotype. ...
