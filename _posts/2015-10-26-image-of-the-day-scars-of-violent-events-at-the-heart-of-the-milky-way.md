>       An international team of astronomers at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics has been scouring cosmic images of X-ray emission, hunting for elusive clues that reveal the culprit responsible for violent acts that have left deep scars on the heart of the Milky Way. The prime suspect is the supermassive black hole lurking at the center of the Milky Way, with a number of massive stars also implicated as suicide bombers. The X-ray broad-band mosaic image above is from more than a hundred individual XMM-Newton observations within the central degree of the Milky Way. The colors indicate observations at different energies; this map covers a region about 500 hundred light years across. In addition to the X-ray emission f...
