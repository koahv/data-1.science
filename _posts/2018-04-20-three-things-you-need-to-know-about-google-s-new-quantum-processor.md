#### Extract
>Given all the buzz, you might be surprised you don&#8217;t have your very own quantum computer yet. The field of quantum computing — in which a processor handles a range of inputs and outputs at once — has pushed new bounds over the last few years. But quantum computers are still largely used for research. For users, the day in which quantum computers are ubiquitous, or even useful, has yet to arrive.
We still aren&#8217;t there yet. But today, we get a step closer — Google unveiled Bristlecone, its latest quantum processor, and its most powerful to date.

Here&#8217;s what you need to know about Bristlecone.
It&#8217;s Packing A Lot of Qubits
Qubits, or quantum bits, are the basic units of information in a quantum processor. The more qubit...
