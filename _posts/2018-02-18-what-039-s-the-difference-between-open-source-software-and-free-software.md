#### Digest
>Free software, open source software, FOSS, FLOSS. Are they the same? Different? Does it matter?



#### Factsheet
>The concept of "free software" was developed by Richard Stallman in the 1980s. The focus is on what the recipient of software is permitted to do with the software: "Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software." "Open source" focuses on the practical consequences enabled by these licenses: surprisingly effective collaboration on software development.
