#### Extract
>To prepare for people for safely journeying into space for extended periods of time in the future, it's crucial to gain a better understanding of the biophysics involved within reduced gravity and microgravity environments. To this end, researchers are preparing to send transparent microscopic worms up to the International Space Station.
