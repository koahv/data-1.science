> (European Association of Geochemistry) So perhaps there is some truth in the old legends of the underworld reeking of brimstone (or sulfur, as it is now called)? New research confirms that the Earth's core does in fact contain vast amounts of sulfur, estimated to be about 10 times the amount of sulfur in the rest of the Earth, based on the most recent estimates (and for comparison, around 10 percent of the total mass of the moon).
