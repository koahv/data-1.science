#### Extract
>       Major international collaboration has seen its first neutrinos – so-called ‘ghost particles,' subatomic, almost massless high-energy  particles that only interact via gravity or nuclear decay, generated in cosmic accelerators: black holes, massive exploding stars and the energetic cores of galaxies.Because they don’t interact with light, they can’t be seen. Neutrinos carry no electric charge and travel through the universe almost entirely unaffected by natural forces. They are considered a fundamental building block of matter. The 2015 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded for neutrino oscillations, a phenomenon that is of great important to the field of elementary particle physics. An international team of scientists at the MicroBooNE physics experiment in the US, including researchers from the University of Cambridge, detected their first neutrino candidates. It represents a milestone for the project, involving years of hard work and a 40-foot-long particle detector that is...
