#### Extract
>(The Henryk Niewodniczanski Institute of Nuclear Physics Polish Academy of Sciences) In the world of elementary particles, traces of a potential 'new physics' may be concealed in processes related to the decay of baryons.  Analysis of data from the LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider performed by scientists from the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Cracow have, however, shown that one of the rarest decays of baryons containing the charm quark so far shows no anomalies....
