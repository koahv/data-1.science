#### Extract
>(American Institute of Physics) Superconductor-ferromagnet structures are widely regarded as the building blocks of superconducting spintronic technology. More conventional spintronic devices typically require large currents, so researchers are investigating the viability of low-resistance superconductors. Their new results could answer longstanding questions about how SF structures interact. They reveal a general mechanism of the long-range electromagnetic proximity effect in SF structures in Applied Physics Letters....
