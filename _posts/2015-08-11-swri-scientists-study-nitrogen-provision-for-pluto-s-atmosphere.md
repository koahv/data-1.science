> (Southwest Research Institute) Scientists at Southwest Research Institute considered what could be replenishing the nitrogen in Pluto's atmosphere in a paper titled, 'On the Provenance of Pluto's Nitrogen' published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Data from the NASA New Horizons Mission hint that Pluto may still be geologically active, a theory that could explain how Pluto's escaping atmosphere remains flush with nitrogen.
