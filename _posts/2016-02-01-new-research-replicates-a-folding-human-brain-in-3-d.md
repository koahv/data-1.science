#### Extract
>(Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences) Understanding how the brain folds could help unlock the inner workings of the brain but the process has long remained a mystery. Now, by replicating a folding human brain in 3-D, researchers at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences have shown that while many molecular processes are important in determining cellular events, what ultimately causes the brain to fold is a simple mechanical instability associated with buckling....
