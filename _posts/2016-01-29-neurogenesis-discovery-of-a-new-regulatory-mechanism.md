#### Extract
>(VIB (the Flanders Institute for Biotechnology)) Bassem Hassan's team at VIB/KU Leuven has discovered a previously unknown mechanism that is highly conserved between species and which regulates neurogenesis through precise temporal control of the activity of a family of proteins essential for brain development: the proneural proteins. This mechanism, a simple reversible chemical modification, is critical for the production of a sufficient number of neurons, their differentiation and the development of the nervous system....
