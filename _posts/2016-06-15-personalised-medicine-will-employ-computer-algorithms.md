#### Extract
>(ITMO University) Russian scientists have developed a software program enabling them to quickly compare sets of DNA of microorganisms living in different environments. The researchers have already suggested exactly how the new program could be applied in practice. Using the algorithm to compare the microflora of a healthy person with the microflora of a patient, specialists would be able to detect previously unknown pathogens and their strains, which can aid the development of personalized medicine. The results of the study have been published in Bioinformatics....
