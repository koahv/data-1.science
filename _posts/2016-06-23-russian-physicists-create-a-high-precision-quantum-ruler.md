#### Extract
>(Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology) Scientists have developed a method which allows to measure large distances (up to a hundred kilometers) with an accuracy comparable to an atomic size.The method is similar to one used in LIGO and relies on an interference of N00N photon states.However, by creating a special kind of entanglement between these states, researchers managed to overcome the problem of energy losses in the transmission medium, thus making it possible to measure extremely large distances....
