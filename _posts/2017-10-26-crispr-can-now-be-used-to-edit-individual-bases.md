#### Extract
>Crisper Than CRISPR CRISPR-Cas9 has been widely heralded as one of the most important scientific developments of recent years, thanks to its capacity to make edits to the human genome. Now, a more precise version of the tool has been developed by a team of scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard. The human genome is made up of chemical bases that are referred to as A, C, G, and T. The new technique is called base editing, and it allows individual bases to be modified without causing a break in the DNA&#8217;s overarching structure. Sometimes, only one base pair in a length of DNA is abnormal in some way â€“ this is called a point mutation, and it accounts for 32,000 of the 50,000 changes in the human genome that...
