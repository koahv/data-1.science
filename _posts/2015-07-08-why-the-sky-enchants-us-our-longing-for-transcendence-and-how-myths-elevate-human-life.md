#### Extract
>&#8220;Human beings have always been mythmakers&#8230; We are meaning-seeking creatures.&#8221;
â€œWe have such a young culture that there is an opportunity to contribute wonderful new myths to it,&#8221; Kurt Vonnegut said in a forgotten 1974 interview. Indeed, we have always used myths both to make sense of the world and to codify our civilizational intentions toward it, by building frameworks of good and evil.
A generation after Joseph Campbell&#8217;s trailblazing work on the power of myth in human life, religion historian Karen Armstrong &#8212; who studies the secular, psychological, and philosophical underpinnings of religion, like compassion and the true meaning of the Golden Rule &#8212; offers a magnificent complementary perspective in A Short History of Myth (public library).
Armstrong writes:
Human beings have always been mythmakers&#8230; We are meaning-seeking creatures. Dogs, as far as we know, do not agonize about the canine condition, worry about the plight of dogs in other parts of the world, or try to see their lives from a different perspective. But human beings fall easily into despair, and from the very beginning we invented stories that enabled us to place our lives in a larger setting, that revealed an underlying pattern, and gave us a sense that, against all the depressing and chaotic evidence to the contrary, life had meaning and value.

One of the most fascinating expressions of mythmaking in our search for meaning has to do with the sky, the sweeping mystery of which has enchanted human beings since the dawn of our species. Ancient astronomers tried to interpret it, Goethe wrote breathtaking poems for it, and Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe captured its mesmerism perfectly in a letter to her best friend: &#8220;There is something wonderful about the bigness and the lonelyness and the windyness of it all.&#8221;
Armstrong traces the origin of the sky&#8217;s ancient allure:
Some of the very earliest myths, probably dating back to the Paleolithic period, were associated with the sky, which seems to have given people their first notion of the divine. When they gazed at the sky &#8212; infinite, remote and existing quite apart from their puny lives &#8212; people had a religious experience. The sky towered above them, inconceivably immense, inaccessible and eternal. It was the very essence of transcendence and otherness. Human beings could do nothing to affect it. The endless drama of its thunderbolts, eclipses, storms, sunsets, rainbows and meteors spoke of another endlessly active dimension, which had a dynamic life of its own. Contemplating the sky filled people with dread and delight, with awe and fear. The sky attracted them and repelled them. It was by its very nature numinous, in the way described by the great historian of religion, Rudolph Otto. In itself, without any imaginary deity behind it, the sky was mysterium tremendum, terribile et fascinans [the terrible, fascinating, and fearsome mystery].

This, Armstrong argues, sheds light on an essential element of our mythical and spiritual consciousness: We often assume that people turn to religion because they want to enlist some higher power in bending the world to their will, to persuade a god or goddess to grant them health and wealth and immortality &#8212; but beneath this impulse lies a deeper longing for transcendence all the more resonant amid our secular culture. She writes:
This very early hierophany shows that worship does not necessarily have a self-serving agenda. People did not want anything from the sky, and they knew perfectly well that they could not affect it in any way. From the very earliest times, we have experienced our world as profoundly mysterious; it holds us in an attitude of awe and wonder, which is the essence of worship&#8230; The experience of pure transcendence was in itself profoundly satisfying. It gave people an ecstatic experience by making them aware of an existence that utterly transcended their own and lifted them emotionally and imaginatively beyond their own limited circumstances. It was inconceivable that the sky could be &#8220;persuaded&#8221; to do the will of poor, weak human beings.
And yet, paradoxically, in any successful mythology transcendence exists on a bell curve of satisfaction &#8212; too little, and we feel spiritually bereft; too much, and we feel cut off from the reality of life. Armstrong explains:
The sky would continue to be a symbol of the sacred long after the Paleolithic period. But a very early development showed that mythology would fail if it spoke of a reality that was too transcendent. If a myth does not enable people to participate in the sacred in some way, it becomes remote and fades from their consciousness.

At some point in human history, we did to the sky what we did to animals &#8212; we personified it in order to better understand its mystery and relate it to human life. Cultures around the world began praying to various versions of a &#8220;Sky God&#8221; or &#8220;High God&#8221; who was believed to have created heaven and earth out of nothing. But the underlying longing remained the same:
When people aspired towards the transcendence represented by the sky, they felt that they could escape from the frailty of the human condition and pass to what lies beyond. That is why mountains are so often holy in mythology: midway between heaven and earth, they were a place where men such as Moses could meet their god. Myths about flight and ascent have appeared in all cultures, expressing a universal desire for transcendence and liberation from the constraints of the human condition.
In order to reap the richness of these myths and their ability to elevate everyday human life, Armstrong argues, it&#8217;s important to see them as what they are &#8212; not factual accounts of real events but powerful metaphors for transcendence:
When we read of Jesus ascending to heaven, we are not meant to imagine him whirling through the stratosphere. When the Prophet Muhammad flies from Mecca to Jerusalem and then climbs up a ladder to the Divine Throne, we are to understand that he has broken through to a new level of spiritual attainment. When the prophet Elijah ascends to heaven in a fiery chariot, he has left the frailty of the human condition behind, and passed away into a sacred realm that lies beyond our earthly experience.

How we&#8217;ve sought to transcend the fragility of the human condition is what Armstrong explores in the remainder of the wholly fascinating A Short History of Myth. For a more playful counterpart, treat yourself to a visual field guide to monster myths and a beautiful illustrated cosmogony of ancient Indian origin myths, then revisit Bertrand Russell on immortality and why religion exists.
