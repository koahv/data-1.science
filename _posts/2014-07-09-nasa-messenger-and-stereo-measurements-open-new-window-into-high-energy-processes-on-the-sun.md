#### Extract
>(NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center) Understanding the sun from afar isn't easy.  NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft -- which orbits Mercury, and so is as close as 28 million miles from the sun versus Earth's 93 million miles -- is near enough to the sun to detect solar neutrons that are created in solar flares.
