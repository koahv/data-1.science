#### Extract
>For the past several years, scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (Berkeley Lab) have been planning the construction of and developing technologies for a very special instrument that will create the most extensive three-dimensional map of the universe to date. Called DESI for Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, this project will trace the growth history of the universe rather like the way you might track your child's height with pencil marks climbing up a doorframe. But DESI will start from the present and work back into the past.
