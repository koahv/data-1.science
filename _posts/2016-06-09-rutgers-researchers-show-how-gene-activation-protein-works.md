#### Extract
>(Rutgers University) Rutgers University scientists have discovered the three-dimensional structure of a gene-specific transcription activation complex, providing the first structural and mechanistic description of the process cells use to turn on, or activate, specific genes in response to changes in cell type, developmental state and environment. Transcription is the first in a series of steps cells take to read out genetic information in DNA.
