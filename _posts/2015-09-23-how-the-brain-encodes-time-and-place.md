#### Extract
>Neuroscientists have now identified a brain circuit that processes the 'when' and 'where' components of memory. Previous models of memory had suggested that the hippocampus, a brain structure critical for memory formation, separates timing and context information. However, the new study shows that this information is split even before it reaches the hippocampus.
