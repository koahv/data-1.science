#### Extract
>(Faculty of Science - University of Copenhagen) Trade of wild birds has dropped 90 percent globally since EU banned bird imports in 2005. A new study in Science Advances demonstrates how it decreased the number of birds traded annually from 1.3 million to 130,000. International trade of wild birds is a root cause of exotic birds spreading worldwide. The study was led by Center for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate, University of Copenhagen and CIBIO-InBIO Research Centre in Biodiversity and Genetic Resources, University of Porto....

#### Factsheet
>International trade of wild birds is a root cause of exotic birds spreading worldwide. Birds are the most traded animals in the world. When wild birds are exported to another country it can lead to biodiversity loss, damage of local ecosystems, crop destroyal, and outcompetion of local birds. Before 2005, a bird group known as passerines constituted almost 80% of all traded birds; today passerine birds constitute less than 20% of trade while parrots have risen to almost 80%. Parrots are a threatened group of bird species and they are most likely to establish in countries it not naturally occurs. Latin America has overtaken West Africa in wild bird exports with a 50% global exportation share worldwide (November 2017).
