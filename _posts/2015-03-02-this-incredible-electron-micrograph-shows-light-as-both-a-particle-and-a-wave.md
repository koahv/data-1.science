#### Extract
>The particle-wave nature of light has fascinated researchers for more than 200 years, butÂ a new experiment has allowed researchers to visualize it like never before. This image was taken by turning an electron microscope on a laser-charged nanowire. Light moved down the wire in both directions, creating a standing wave of photons, which the electron microscope was able to capture by focusing on the wire. The result is an image that captures both the wave and particle nature of light. A wave is clearly visible in the curves of the figure, but each data point represents a unique interaction between a photon and an electron, slowing or speeding the electron enough to be measured by the microscope.
