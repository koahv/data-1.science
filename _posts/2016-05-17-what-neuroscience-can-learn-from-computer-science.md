#### Extract
>What do computers and brains have in common? Computers are made to solve the same problems that brains solve. Computers, however, rely on a drastically different hardware, which makes them good at different kinds of problem solving. For example, computers do much better than brains at chess, while brains do much better than computers at object recognition. A study published in PLOS ONE found that even bumblebee brains are amazingly good at selecting visual images with color, symmetry and spatial frequency properties suggestive of flowers. Despite their differences, computer science and neuroscience often inform each other....
