#### Extract
>Scientists from Wageningen University & Research have found natural genetic variation for photosynthesis in plants and are unravelling it to the DNA level. As a result it should be possible to breed crops that use photosynthesis more effectively in the future, increasing their yield and enabling them to capture more CO2 from the air in the soil. This represents a major step on the long road to solving global food challenges and realising the Paris climate agreement....

#### Factsheet
>It is possible to improve photosynthesis based on natural genetic variation. This means crops could produce more yield with the same amount of soil, water and nutrients. Plants need light to convert CO2 and water into sugars and oxygen.
