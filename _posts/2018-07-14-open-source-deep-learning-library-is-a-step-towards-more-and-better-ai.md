 Deep learning is a broad field of research with the objective of creating artificial intelligence that is capable of instructing itself to perform tasks rather than relying on algorithms. In theory, this would allow AI to succeed at tasks that would be prohibitively difficult, resource-intensive, or time-consuming for a human developer to work on. However, deep learning requires dedicated experts to oversee and develop the AI â€” undermining some of the intent behind having AI that can self-teach. If you need an expert on hand regardless, why do you need an AI capable of deep learning? AWS and Microsoft seek to change that.
 In October, AWS and Microsoft announced that they were working together to create Gluon, an open-source deep learning...
