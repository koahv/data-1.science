>An illustration of the molecule used by Columbia Engineering professor. Credit: Latha Venkataraman, Columbia Engineering Under the direction of Latha Venkataraman, associate professor of applied physics at Columbia Engineering, researchers have designed a new technique to create a single-molecule diode, and, in doing so, they have developed molecular diodes that perform 50 times better than all prior designs. Venkataraman&#8217;s group is the first to develop a single-molecule diode that may have real-world technological applications for nanoscale devices. Their paper, &#8220;Single-Molecule Diodes with High On-Off Ratios through Environmental Control,&#8221; is published May 25 in Nature Nanotechnology. &#8220;Our new approach created a si...
