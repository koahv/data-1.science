#### Extract
>(University of Nebraska-Lincoln) A team of physicists from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Stanford University and Europe has captured the clearest glimpse yet of a photochemical reaction -- the type of light-fueled molecular transformations responsible for photosynthesis, vision and the ozone layer. Appearing in the June 6 edition of the journal Science, the team's study marks the culmination of a years-long effort to advance the quality of 'molecular movies' from that of a rudimentary stop-motion animation to a high-definition motion picture....
