Thorne (Caltech), and Barry C. Barish (Caltech) have been chosen by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for the award thanks to their decisive contributions in the development of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and their observations of gravitational waves.<br> <em>LIGO</em></p></div>
<p>This could have been an exciting day for Albert Einstein &mdash; were he alive, of course. The Nobel Prize in physics for 2017 has been awarded to three researchers for their work helping to prove a prediction he made more than 100 years ago, based on his general theory of relativity: the existence of gravitational waves.</p>
<p>Ranier Weiss (MIT), Kip S. Thorne (Caltech), and Barry C. Barish (Caltech) have been chosen by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for the award thanks to their decisive contributions in the development of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and their observations of gravitational waves.</p>
<p>LIGO consists of two L-shaped laser interferometers, each four kilometers in length, located on opposite sides of the United States. When a gravitational wave &mdash; a ripple in spacetime produced by an accelerating mass &mdash; reaches the instrument, the wobble it creates in the dimensions of spacetime itself produces minuscule variations (on the order of 10<sup>-18</sup> meter, or a million trillionth of a meter) in the length of the interferometer. LIGO measures these tiny stretches and squeezes with its extremely sensitive instruments.</p>
<p>The prize has been awarded to Weiss, Thorne, and Barish, but it&rsquo;s an acknowledgement of the efforts of roughly 1,000 participants of a project that has been almost 50 years in the works, since Weiss first came up with the idea of an interferometer for detecting gravitational waves. After developing a prototype at MIT in the early 1970s, Weiss teamed up in 1976 with Caltech physicist Kip Thorne, who was instrumental in developing physicists&rsquo; understanding of gravitational waves.</p>
<p>In 1979 they started working with Scottish experimentalist Ronald Drever (1931&ndash;2017) and together founded the LIGO project. Drever, who added key improvements to Weiss&rsquo;s detector design, might have been the third recipient of this Nobel, if not for his death this year. Barish came onboard as principal investigator after the project started, becoming science director in 1997. He oversaw critical stages of LIGO&rsquo;s construction and contributed to securing funding for the project.</p>
<p><strong>The Revolution of Gravitational Waves</strong></p>
<p>LIGO&rsquo;s first detection of gravitational waves happened in <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/gravitational-wave-detection-heralds-new-era-of-science-0211201644/http:/www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/gravitational-wave-detection-heralds-new-era-of-science-0211201644/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">September&nbsp;2015</a>, after years of tuning and refining the instrument. Three more detections came afterwards, the last one announced just a few days ago <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/fourth-gravitational-wave-event-detected/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on September 27</a>th. The latest discovery included observations from the Advanced Virgo detector of the European Gravitational Observatory near Pisa, Italy, which enabled researchers to pinpoint the location of the waves&rsquo; source in the sky with much better precision than previously possible.</p>
<p>All four detections so far appear to come from the merger of stellar-mass black holes, objects with the mass of dozens of Suns contained within a couple hundred kilometers, which is less than the distance between Boston and New York. These objects do not emit any kind of electromagnetic radiation. Before LIGO, astrophysicists didn&rsquo;t know that black holes existed at these masses, or even that they could come in pairs, Weiss said in a press conference a few hours after the award announcement. Weiss also said that many (including him) thought that LIGO would detect neutron stars first, mostly because astronomers already knew they existed in binaries&mdash;which made them a better justification to get funding, he joked.</p>
<p>Although LIGO has not yet announced any detection of neutron star mergers, Weiss hinted an announcement may be coming on October 16th (so brace yourselves for more gravitational wave hubbub very soon).</p>
<p>Gravitational waves open an entirely unexplored route for scientists, like developing an entirely new sense to feel their way around. &ldquo;With these instruments we have opened a new field of astronomy and astrophysics, so the real payoff will be in the future,&rdquo; Weiss said. &ldquo;This [gravitational-wave] radiation is caused by accelerating mases and is so penetrating that nothing perturbs its travel to Earth at all, so it will allow us to see new things and look to what we already know in a new way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scientists hope that gravitational waves will bring new insights to many longstanding questions in astrophysics and cosmology. Questions such as how stiff matter is at its most extreme pressures to how heavy elements are made, how black holes and pulsars rotate over long periods of time &mdash; and not only when they smash &mdash;and even studying the imprint of the <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/cosmic-inflation-b-modes-signal-just-dust-0203201523/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inflationary epoch of the universe</a></p>
<p>The field of gravitational astronomy is just starting, and we are posed to see very exciting developments in the near future. New ground and space-based instruments are already planned and under construction. The <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-blogs/kagra-japans-underground-einstein-wave-detector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kamioka Gravitational-Wave Detector</a> is being built in Japan, and it will use extremely cold temperatures to reach high levels of sensitivity. In India, <a href="http://www.gw-indigo.org/tiki-index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another interferometer</a> will join the LIGO and Virgo collaboration, implementing a spare instrument built by the LIGO team. Finally, the first space-based gravitational wave detector, <a href="https://lisa.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LISA</a>, is scheduled to launch in 2030 by the European Space Agency and NASA.</p>
<p>The future looks bright for gravitational astronomy.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span><b><i>The launch of Sputnik 1, Earth's first artificial satellite, paved the way for Moonwalking astronauts, robotic exploration of the planets, and space tourism.</i></b></span></p>
<div>

</div>
<p>Sixty years after it officially began on October 4, 1957, we still often refer to the era we live in as the Space Age. Our extraterrestrial explorations have planted a set of mileposts in our memories &mdash; from those first brief forays into weightlessness to permanently occupied space stations, from spindly probes snapping a few pictures while whizzing past a distant planet to rovers probing every nook and cranny and telescopes peering into the deepest vastness. It&rsquo;s no surprise that venturing beyond our home planet is considered by many to be the defining achievement of our era, a symbolic pinnacle of human civilization.</p>
<p>But for the United States, at least, the Space Age began not with glory but with worldwide humiliation.</p>
<p>In mid-1955 President Dwight Eisenhower declared that the nation would place a scientific satellite into orbit during the upcoming International Geophysical Year, a worldwide 18-month stretch of cooperative research. The IGY kicked off with much fanfare on July 1, 1957, with the U.S. envisioning a satellite launch later that year. But before the planned Vanguard satellite ever met its rocket, on October 4th a persistent beeping from orbit revealed that the Soviet Union had orbited the world&rsquo;s first satellite, Sputnik 1, and in doing so had won the first leg of what would become a race to space.</p>
<p>Sputnik wasn&rsquo;t much of a satellite, but it was a beefy 184-pound beach ball compared to Vanguard&rsquo;s 3-pound grapefruit. Amateur skygazers, <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/skytel/beyondthepage/9313906.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobilized worldwide</a> to track the first satellites, watched it pass overhead through their telescopes. And its simple beeping signal, powerful enough to be picked up by amateur radio operators around the world, left no doubt that the achievement was real.</p>
<p>Just a month later, on November 3rd, the USSR awed the world again by launching the first space traveler, a small mongrel dog named Laika, aboard Sputnik 2.</p>
<div>
	<img src="http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Explorer1_and_3guys_m.jpg" alt="Explorer 1 celebration">
	<div>Holding aloft a model of Explorer 1 at a post-launch press conference in 1958 are (from left): William H. Pickering of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory; James A. Van Allen, whose instrument discovered radiation belts encircling Earth; and Wernher von Braun, leader of the US Army team that built the Juno launch rocket.</div>
	<div><i>NASA</i></div>
</div>
<p>The US effort swung into overdrive. After a spectacular Vanguard launch failure, televised live that December, Washington officials gave the nod to a parallel satellite program headed by Wernher von Braun, and Explorer 1 rocketed into orbit successfully on January 31, 1958. It was followed on March 17th by Vanguard 1 &mdash; which, as just the fourth satellite ever launched from Earth, remains in orbit today. Later that year, Congress created a new agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), to lead the fledgling U.S. space effort.</p>
<p>Today we take so much of what followed Sputnik 1 into space for granted. We think little of the fact that a phone call from here to the next town might bounce off a satellite 22,400 miles overhead, that a few keystrokes can instantly summon an online satellite view of anywhere on Earth, that space has become the ultimate platform for observing our universe, or that we can send little remote-controlled vehicles to probe odd-looking rocks on a planet 100 million miles away.</p>
<p>And nowadays even the promise of inexpensive, routine flights into space is back again, but in a new guise: an armada of entrepreneurs who think that the open market can deliver what decades of government bureaucracy could not. Eager customers have already snapped up $200,000 tickets for half-hour flights to the fringes of space, while space hotels and even privately-funded Moon bases are taking shape on computerized drawing boards.</p>
<div>
	<img src="http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Apollo-footprint_m.jpg" alt="Apollo 11 footprint">
	<div>The touchdown of Apollo 11 on the Moon on July 20, 1969, is still considered by many to have been the pinnacle of human achievement in space to date.</div>
	<div><i>NASA</i></div>
</div>
<p>The first 60 years of space exploration was just the bumpy beginning of what might be an endless, gradual expansion &mdash; just our first walks around the block after leaving the cradle of Earth. The decades ahead will no doubt bring us face to face with marvels we can&rsquo;t yet imagine, as we explore our near and distant environs more deeply.</p>
<p>But there will always remain something special in our collective human memory about the first halting steps made into the cosmos that surrounds us. Even the language we use, in dozens of words and phrases, now draw from the A-OK&rsquo;s, the nominals, and the major malfunctions of the space program.</p>
<p>As we strive to understand the universe we live in, all systems are go, and the countdown has just begun.</p>

For example, locating a website would look like this when you type it in: https://54.204.39.132, which would be nearly impossible for most of us to remember. Of course, using bookmarks would help, but suppose your friend tells you about a cool new website and tells you to go to 54.204.39.132. How would you remember that? Telling someone to go to "Opensource.com" is far easier to remember. And, yes, that is our IP address.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The transition to land from our fishy ancestors is one of the most iconic, and best documented, transitions in the fossil record. We know that fleshy-limbed fish living in shallows used their limbs to move in the shallows and then up onto land, and became tetrapods (4-legged vertebrates) along the way. What has been less well-studied is the transition to vision in air that also occurred during that evolutionary event. Vision in air is different, and in some ways easier, than seeing in water. According to a new study by Malcolm MacIver of Northwestern University and Lars Schmitz of the Claremont Colleges, early tetrapod ancestors may have been seeing like land-based animals before they were moving like them.</p>]]></content>

But conventional panels are not without environmental costs, too. Now scientists are reporting in the Journal of the American Chemical Society a new advance toward more practical, 'greener' solar cells made with inexpensive halide perovskite materials.

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the high environmental cost of conventional energy sources and the finite supply of fossil fuels, the importance of renewable energy sources has become much more apparent in recent years. However, efficiently harnessing solar energy for human use has been a difficult task. While silicon-based solar cells can be used to capture sunlight energy, they are costly to produce on an industrial scale. Research from the Energy Materials and Surface Sciences Unit at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), led by Prof. Yabing Qi, has focused on using organo-metal halide perovskite films in solar cells. These perovskite films are highly crystalline materials that can be formed by a large number of different chemical combinations and can be deposited at low cost. Recent publications from Prof. Qi's lab cover three different areas of innovation in perovskite film research: a novel post annealing treatment to increase perovskite efficiency and stability, a discovery of the decomposition products of a specific perovskite, and a new means of producing perovskites that maintains solar efficiency when scaled up.</p>]]></content>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that birds and crocodiles are practically cousins? Around 230 million years ago, you wouldn't have been able to tell the difference between the two different lineages. This is because birds and crocodilians (which includes alligators, caiman, and gharials) are part of a much larger group called Archosauria, or ruling lizards, which means they share a common ancestor far back in time. When they split from each other, they formed two major evolutionary pathways: the bird-line archosaurs, which also includes all dinosaurs, and the crocodile-line archosaurs, which includes crocodilians and their ancestors, the crocodylomorphs.</p>]]></content>

Embedded Linux shares the same source code base as desktop Linux, but it is coupled with different user interface tools and other high-level components. The base of the system is essentially the same.</p>

<p>Let's look at a few common cases.</p>

<p>The original Pi Zero was great (and still is!)&mdash;but many people found its lack of wireless connectivity an inconvenience. Now with Zero W, you can connect to the Internet without using any adapters, and you can even use a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard rather than wired USB, or use a Bluetooth speaker for audio.</p>
<p>The latest addition to the Raspberry Pi family has the same specifications as the original Pi Zero:</p>

He was a user of vi on Unix, but the Amiga didn't have anything quite like it. On November 2, 1991, after three years in development, he released the first version of the "Vi IMitation" editor, or <a href="http://www.vim.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vim</a>.</p>

<p>The International Astronomical Union (IAU) has <a href="https://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau1704/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">officially approved</a> the names of 14 geological features on the surface of Pluto. All of these remained devoid of officially-sanctioned monikers two years after the flyby of NASA&rsquo;s New Horizons spacecraft that obtained high-resolution images of the dwarf planet&rsquo;s surface for the first time. (The IAU is empowered by the world's astronomers as the <a href="https://www.iau.org/public/themes/buying_star_names/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the sole naming authority</a> for astronomical objects and its features.)</p>
<p>Pluto's just-approved names belong to four broad themes previously accepted by IAU. The themes are pioneering space missions, historic explorers who crossed new frontiers, scientists and engineers who contributed to our knowledge of Pluto and the Kuiper Belt, and underworld mythology &mdash; since the names of Pluto and its five moons already fell in that category.</p>
<p>NASA&rsquo;s New Horizons team made the naming proposal to the IAU after collecting suggestions from the public during an on-line campaign called <a href="http://www.ourpluto.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our Pluto</a>. The team also added to the list some of the names they had been used informally during science operations.</p>
<p>Although the IAU has insisted in keeping the naming scheme limited to the approved list of themes, some controversy arose in 2015 when researchers began to <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/unofficially-naming-pluto-0723201566/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">use informal names for Pluto&rsquo;s features</a> in different communications, <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/pluto-results-in-science-101520155/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including research papers</a>. Some of these names, such as Cthulhu Regio, Balrog Macula, or Spock crater, were related to science-fiction and fantasy literature and clearly out of the boundaries of IAU&rsquo;s traditional themes.</p>
<p>It didn't help that that the New Horizons team, understandably preoccupied with analyzing the results of 2015's historic flyby, took its time before submitting a list of feature names for formal approval &mdash; yet freely used informal names in publications and presentations. <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/iau-names-stars-and-planets-121820155/#plutonames" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> The situation got a little testy</a> at the IAU's 2015 General Assembly between Alan Stern, principal investigator for New Horizons, and the IAU's <a href="https://www.iau.org/science/scientific_bodies/working_groups/98/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature.</a> But the relationship improved after the two groups finally began to meet in August 2016.</p>
<p>The first 14 approved feature names are:</p>
<p><strong>Tombaugh Regio</strong>&nbsp;honors Clyde Tombaugh (1906&ndash;97), the U.S. astronomer who discovered Pluto in 1930 from Lowell Observatory in Arizona.</p>
<p><strong>Burney crater</strong>&nbsp;honors Venetia Burney (1918&ndash;2009), who as an 11-year-old schoolgirl suggested the name &ldquo;Pluto&rdquo; for Clyde Tombaugh&rsquo;s newly discovered world. Later in life she taught mathematics and economics.</p>
<p><strong>Sputnik Planitia</strong>&nbsp;is a broad, low-lying plain named after Sputnik 1, the first space satellite, launched by the Soviet Union in 1957.</p>
<p><strong>Tenzing Montes</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Hillary Montes</strong>&nbsp;are mountain ranges honoring Tenzing Norgay (1914&ndash;86) and Sir Edmund Hillary (1919&ndash;2008), the Indian/Nepali Sherpa and New Zealand mountaineer who were the first to reach the summit of Mount Everest and return safely. (Tenzing Montes, initially called Norgay Montes, was switched because Tenzing is the family surname.)</p>
<p><strong>Al-Idrisi Montes</strong>&nbsp;honors Ash-Sharif al-Idrisi (1100&ndash;65/66), a noted Arab mapmaker and geographer whose landmark work of medieval geography is sometimes translated as &ldquo;The Pleasure of Him Who Longs to Cross the Horizons.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Djanggawul Fossae</strong>&nbsp;defines a network of long, narrow depressions named for the Djanggawuls, three ancestral beings in indigenous Australian mythology who traveled between the island of the dead and Australia, creating the landscape and filling it with vegetation.</p>
<p><strong>Sleipnir Fossa</strong>&nbsp;is named for the powerful, eight-legged horse of Norse mythology that carried the god Odin into the underworld.</p>
<p><strong>Virgil Fossae</strong>&nbsp;honors Virgil, one of the greatest Roman poets and Dante&rsquo;s fictional guide through hell and purgatory in the&nbsp;<em>Divine Comedy</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Adlivun Cavus</strong>&nbsp;is a deep depression named for Adlivun, the underworld in Inuit mythology.</p>
<p><strong>Hayabusa Terra</strong>&nbsp;is a large land mass saluting the Japanese spacecraft and mission (2003&ndash;10) that returned the first asteroid sample.</p>
<p><strong>Voyager Terra</strong>&nbsp;honors the <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/cheers-to-40-years-voyager-1-and-2-going-strong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">twin NASA spacecraft, launched in 1977</a>, that performed the first &ldquo;grand tour&rdquo; of all four giant planets. Voyagers 1 and 2 are now probing the boundary between the Sun and interstellar space.</p>
<p><strong>Tartarus Dorsa</strong>&nbsp;is a ridge named for Tartarus, the deepest, darkest pit of the underworld in Greek mythology.</p>
<p><strong>Elliot crater&nbsp;</strong>recognizes James Elliot (1943&ndash;2011), an MIT researcher who pioneered the use of stellar occultations to study the Solar System &mdash; leading to discoveries such as the rings of Uranus and the first detection of Pluto's thin atmosphere.</p>
<p>There is no word regarding when more features will receive official recognition, but space aficionados are closely watching for approval of informal names for features on Charon. Those themes, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-new-horizons-iau-set-pluto-naming-themes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">approved by the IAU's Working Group earlier this year</a>, include fictional characters, destinations, and vessels associated with space exploration. So get ready for craters named Sulu, Vader, and Skywalker.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><span><em>Barely visible water-ice clouds coast across Mars&rsquo;s skies in new videos from the Curiosity rover.</em></span></strong></p>
<div><img src="http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/PIA21841_NRB_Sol01758_553537959_Zenith.gif" alt="Thin clouds float above NASA&rsquo;s Curiosity Mars Rover last July." width="600" height="600"><p>Thin clouds float above NASA&rsquo;s Curiosity Mars Rover last July. This videos is made from eight still images each taken over a period of four minutes by Curiosity&rsquo;s Navcam camera.&nbsp;<br><em>NASA / JPL-Caltech / York University</em></p></div>
<p>Every now and then, the operators of NASA&rsquo;s Mars Science Laboratory mission Curiosity take a break from avoiding sand traps and analyzing rocks for <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/uncategorized/curiosity-discoveries-mars/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">signs of ancient, habitable environments</a> and instead point the rover&rsquo;s robotic eyes to the sky to look at the clouds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they did last month on July 17th, when early in the Martian morning they pointed Curiosity&rsquo;s Navigation Camera (Navcam) up to capture two image sequences of feathery clouds as they drifted overhead.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA21841" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first clip</a> shows smoky thin clouds moving from left to right as they pass right above the rover. <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA21840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In the second</a>, the camera is aimed to the southern horizon line, revealing how a thin layer of similarly wispy clouds floats above two rounded hills. The Martian clouds shown in the videos look strikingly familiar and Earth-like. According to NASA, these cloud images are the &ldquo;most clearly visible so far from Curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each sequence is made of eight images taken over a 4-minute time span. They have been processed to adjust for sensitivity differences among pixels in the camera&rsquo;s sensor and to remove lens artifacts and then creating an &ldquo;average&rdquo; of all the frames and subtracting it from each individual frame. These corrections enhance the changes caused by movement and lightning &ndash; at the cost of adding some extra grain &ndash; making the clouds easier to see. NASA also published a <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA21842" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">version of the first video without enhancements</a> where the clouds are much less noticeable.</p>

<p>Although the rover&rsquo;s operators most likely appreciate the change of subject, this is not a leisure activity. Researchers have been observing the Martian sky from the planet&rsquo;s surface from years, using Curiosity and other previous missions such as the Phoenix Mars Lander, in order to study its climate.</p>
<p>Thanks to these observations as well as others by orbiting spacecraft and the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists have learned much about Mars&rsquo;s cloud regime, which is driven by the planet&rsquo;s elliptical orbit. When Mars is closer to the Sun, the extra sunlight it receives heats things up and can create global dust storms that may prevent cloud formation. As it moves away from our star and cools down, clouds begin to form in two major systems: made of frozen carbon dioxide on top of the colder poles and made of water-ice along a wide band following the equator.</p>
<p>These videos show examples of the second type &ndash; water-ice cirrus clouds similar to the ones found on Earth.</p>
<p>You can read more about the videos in <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6917" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory&rsquo;s</a> press release.</p>
