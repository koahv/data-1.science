	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><i><span>Latest version of annual report demonstrates the continued growth in interest and participation in the Linux kernel, as well as accelerating rate of change</span></i></p>
<p><b>PRAGUE (Open Source Summit Europe) &ndash; October 25, 2017 &ndash;</b> <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>The Linux Foundation</span></a><span>, the nonprofit organization enabling mass innovation through open source, </span><span>today announced the immediate release of its </span><a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/2017-linux-kernel-report-landing-page/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>2017 Linux Kernel Development Report</span></a><span>. The report analyzes the work done by 15,600 developers over more than a decade, as well as more recent trends. </span></p>
<p><span>This is the eighth such report that is released on a roughly annual basis to help illustrate the Linux kernel development process and the work that defines the largest collaborative project in the history of computing. This year&rsquo;s paper covers work completed through Linux kernel 4.13, with an emphasis on releases 4.8 to 4.13. The last report was released in August 2016 and focused on 3.19 to 4.7.</span></p>
<p><span>Key findings from this year&rsquo;s paper include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Roughly 15,600 developers from more than 1,400 companies have contributed to the Linux kernel </span><span>since the adoption of Git made detailed tracking possible</span><span>. Since the last report, over 4,300 developers from more than 500 companies have contributed to the kernel; 1,670 of these developers contributed for the first time, comprising about a third of contributors. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>The Top 10 organizations sponsoring Linux kernel development since the last report include Intel, Red Hat, Linaro, IBM, Samsung, SUSE, Google, AMD, Renesas and Mellanox. The complete top 30 contributing organizations can be seen in the full report.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>The rate of Linux development continues to increase, as does the number of developers and companies involved in the process. The average number of changes accepted into the kernel per hour is 8.5, a significant increase from the 7.8 changes in the last report, which translates to 204 changes every day and over 1,400 per week. The average days of development per release increased slightly to 67.66 days from 66 last year, with every release spaced either 63 or 70 days apart, providing significant predictability. The 4.9 and 4.12 development cycles featured the highest patch rates ever seen in the history of the kernel project.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>The number of unpaid developers may be stabilizing, with these developers contributing 8.2% of contributions, a slight increase from 7.7% in last year&rsquo;s report. This is still significantly down from the 11.8% reported in 2014. This is likely due to kernel developers being in short supply, leading those who demonstrate the ability to submit quality patches to not have trouble finding job offers.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The report is co-authored by </span><span>Jonathan</span><span> Corbet, Linux kernel developer and editor of LWN.net, and Greg Kroah-Hartman, Linux kernel maintainer and Linux Foundation fellow. This year&rsquo;s report also features interviews with 17 Linux kernel developers and maintainers.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;The incredible rates of contribution and participation in the Linux kernel demonstrate the continued strength and scalability of the kernel community,&rdquo; said Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation. &ldquo;This report provides important information that helps show how incredibly effective the collaborative development model can be for one of the most essential software projects in history.&rdquo;</span></p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Collisions of lead nuclei in the LHC form the hot, dense medium known as the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Experimentally, the QGP is characterised by the collective flow of emerging quarks and gluons. They fragment into highly collimated "jets" of particles that in turn lose energy through a phenomenon known as jet quenching. Studying this effect can improve the understanding of quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the strong nuclear interaction that governs the behaviour of the QGP.</p>]]></content>

	<title type="html">The Next Most Powerful Supercomputer in the U.S. Is Almost Complete</title>
	<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Computing for Science
Inside one of the rooms of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) at Tenness...</p>]]></summary>
	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Computing for Science</h2>
<p>Inside one of the rooms of the <a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)</a> at Tennessee, the next fastest and most powerful supercomputer in the U.S. is getting ready to solve some of science&rsquo;s biggest questions. Meet the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/summit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Summit supercomputer</a>, which is designed to be the predecessor to ORNL&rsquo;s current high-performance supercomputer called Titan.</p>
<p>Supercomputers have been around for some time now. The high-performance computing these devices are capable of make them ideal for running larger and more complex computational problems, such as those that deal with questions of science. For Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility project director Buddy Bland, these type of big problems would make a good test for Summit&rsquo;s capabilities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;We will try to run some big problems,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/2017/10/17/summit-supercomputer-exascale-oak-ridge-national-lab/750965001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he told the </a><i><a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/2017/10/17/summit-supercomputer-exascale-oak-ridge-national-lab/750965001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Knoxville News Sentinel</a></i>, referring to the period of &ldquo;early science&rdquo; Summit will be busy with as soon as it becomes operational in 2018. The remaining parts of Summit will come in February, Bland said, &ldquo;Then we would expect the machine to be built up and accepted sometime next summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once built, the science problems Summit will tackle include testing and developing stronger, lighter manufacturing materials; the use of sound waves to model the inside of the Earth; and other astrophysics projects that explore the universe&rsquo;s origins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For instance, we&rsquo;ll be looking into why supernovae explode,&rdquo; Bland said. &ldquo;When stars explode, they create all of the elements we find in the universe, everything that&rsquo;s part of you and me and part of this planet gets created.&rdquo; The ORNL team expects Summit to be available for open research by 2019.</p>
<h2>Radically More Powerful Supercomputer</h2>
<p>Currently, the world&rsquo;s fastest and most powerful supercomputer is in China.&nbsp;<a href="https://futurism.com/china-builds-the-worlds-fastest-supercomputer-93-petaflops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sunway TaihuLight</a>&nbsp;is capable of 93 peta floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) of computing power, with a theoretical peak of 125 petaFLOPS. A FLOP measures computing speed, and a petaFLOP is equal to one thousand million million (10<sup>15</sup>) FLOPS. Today&rsquo;s regular computers, in contrast, can only perform about 63GFLOPS, although <a href="https://www.popsci.com/intel-teraflop-chip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intel has developed a chip</a> that can give your desktop computer some teraFLOPS of power.<figure><a href="https://futurism.com/images/meet-powerful-computers-world/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="https://futurism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/supercomputers_home.jpg" alt="Meet The Most Powerful Computers in the World"></a><figcaption><strong><a href="https://futurism.com/images/meet-powerful-computers-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click to View Full Infographic</a></strong></figcaption></figure>
</p><p>Summit, on the other hand, would be capable of 200 petaFLOPS, which potentially outperforms the Sunway TaihuLight. It&rsquo;s able to do this thanks to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/what-is-gpu-computing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPU-accelerated computing</a>, which means it uses a central processing unit&nbsp;&mdash; like regular computers do&nbsp;&mdash; but is coupled with graphical processing units (GPUs) to perform computations. GPUs create realistic visuals in video games, but they also help scientists when they use supercomputers to understand physical phenomenon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the first time, we were able to do a simulation of a star exploding in three dimensions and we found that it wasn&rsquo;t symmetric all the way around,&rdquo; Bland said, referring to an exploding star simulation ORNL ran on the Titan. &ldquo;When a star starts collapsing in on itself and then explodes out, you&rsquo;ve got these rolling and tumbling things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In short, the Summit will be the fastest supercomputer around by 2018. But ORNL doesn&rsquo;t want to stop there. By 2021, they plan on developing the world&rsquo;s first exascale computer, capable of processing information at one exaFLOP or a billion billion operations per second. That&rsquo;s 50 times faster than the fastest supercomputer. Still, <a href="https://futurism.com/the-eight-most-powerful-supercomputers-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as powerful as these supercomputers</a> will be, scientists are also looking forward to a universal quantum computer.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>A Tiny, Huge Discovery</h2>
<p>On July 4th, 2012, researchers&nbsp;from&nbsp;the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) made a big announcement. They had observed the Higgs boson, an elementary particle predicted by&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;best models for physics in the universe.&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;We discovered the particle that makes it possible for atoms to form in the first place.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s much sexier,&rdquo; James Beacham, a particle physicist at CERN, said&nbsp;of the discovery in an interview at&nbsp;<a href="http://brainbar.com/speaker/james-beacham" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brain Bar Budapest,</a> a future-oriented science festival in Hungary held in June.</p>
<p>Those in the know might have been anticipating this observation for decades, but that didn&rsquo;t dampen the excitement. The discovery marked the culmination of a 40-year scientific effort, as Beacham noted, and it&nbsp;<a href="https://home.cern/topics/higgs-boson" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">garnered the Nobel Prize in physics in 2013</a>.</p>
<p>Most discoveries in physics remain far from the public eye, esoteric and uninviting to the masses. But this discovery of a new particle, predicted by many and finally observed after so much work and anticipation &mdash; was different. It sparked a media frenzy, <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-08-27/physics-failure-brings-almost-much-excitement-success" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the excitement from which continued well beyond</a>&nbsp;the days and weeks after the discovery was announced.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Moving On</h2>
<p>There was great success and celebration, but every party has to end. After the discovery of the Higgs boson, CERN scientists seemed to fall into a slow, sullen post-discovery period, if <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/science/cern-large-hadron-collider-higgs-physics.html?_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a recent article from the <em>New York Times</em></a>&nbsp;is to be believed.</p>
<p>Beacham paints a different picture. From his telling, CERN isn&rsquo;t stalling out, it&rsquo;s in a honeymoon phase. The Higgs boson discovery really just answered one question: whether or not it existed, he said at the June event. &ldquo;The second we found [the Higgs boson], that was not enough for us. We&nbsp;want to know every single one of its properties,&rdquo; Beacham said. &ldquo;Even before we announced it&hellip;we were ahead.&rdquo; This discovery had been predicted for so long that, while the observation itself was thrilling, CERN researchers were already working on&nbsp;what else this observation could reveal.</p>
<p>Discovering the Higgs boson&nbsp;created many more questions than it answered &mdash; physics is funny like that. &ldquo;So for us, there was no celebration downtime,&rdquo; Beacham said. That&rsquo;s in part because the Higgs is &ldquo;a crazy particle,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unlike anything else that we know of in the Standard Model.&rdquo; Predicting the Higgs boson came with so many precise conditions that its existence&nbsp;allows scientists to test&nbsp;a number of other conditions that the model predicts.</p>
<p>This is how Beacham and a lot of other CERN scientists are spending their time these days&nbsp;&mdash; exploring questions never before answered, with this discovery serving as a magnificent jumping off point.&nbsp;&ldquo;Now, the current and foreseeable future for&nbsp;ATLAS [one of the five major experiments at CERN]&nbsp;is to make sure that we&rsquo;re not going to miss anything,&rdquo; he said. That is, he admits, a little vague, but that&rsquo;s the beauty of this type of exploration. There are still particles that physicists have predicted, but which no one has yet observed. The more we discover, the more complex the universe becomes to us.&nbsp;&ldquo;[CERN is] one of the most sophisticated devices that anyone has ever designed, and we have to do our damnedest to make sure that we don&rsquo;t miss anything,&rdquo; Beacham said.</p>
<p>There were those who viewed the discovery of the Higgs boson&nbsp;with a sort of finality &mdash; a tremendously anticipated observation that would tell researchers one way or another if they were right or if somehow they&rsquo;d misinterpreted the trusted standard model.&nbsp;But that&rsquo;s not how physicists see it.</p>
<p>Physics, like many fields that pursue knowledge and truth, is a winding path punctuated&nbsp;by jumps and halts.&nbsp;Beacham wasn&rsquo;t able to&nbsp;predict&nbsp;exactly what the next big discovery might be, but the curiosity and uncertainty are&nbsp;part of what makes discovery and the endless quest to answer &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; so magical.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a guest post by Dr. Danna Staaf, a science writer with a PhD in marine biology from Stanford University. Her first book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Squid-Empire-Rise-Fall-Cephalopods/dp/1611689236" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Squid Empire: The Rise and Fall of the Cephalopods</a>, chronicles the 500-million-year evolutionary journey of these fascinating animals. She also blogs at <a href="http://www.cephalopodiatrist.com/p/home.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Cephalopodiatrist</a>.</em></p>
<p>Giant squid are the sea&rsquo;s best monsters, tentacles down. For evidence we need look no further than the logo of this very website. But did you know that our beloved <em>Architeuthis</em> descends from a venerable line of sea monsters&mdash;that Archy&rsquo;s ancestors, in fact, may have been the first animals ever to merit the name &ldquo;mons<span>ter&rdquo;?</span></p>
<p><img src="http://www.deepseanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1_kraken-300x440.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="440" srcset="http://www.deepseanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1_kraken-300x440.jpg 300w, http://www.deepseanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1_kraken-102x150.jpg 102w, http://www.deepseanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1_kraken-768x1126.jpg 768w, http://www.deepseanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1_kraken-600x880.jpg 600w, http://www.deepseanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1_kraken.jpg 1397w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;prehistoric sea monster&rdquo; might summon to mind an <a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/ichthyosauria.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ichthyosaur</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalodon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">megalodon</a>, but these are johnny-come-latelies to the underwater scene. Megalodon showed up a mere 23 million years ago. Ichthyosaurs evolved closer to 250 million years ago, which may seem pretty old (okay, it is) until you consider the age of the first cephalopod: 450 million years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll admit that initially cephalopods were no monsters. Snail-like, they lived inside shells that measured a few centimeters at most. But these shells contained a remarkable evolutionary innovation: sealed-off chambers that could be drained of fluid and filled with buoyant gas.</p>
<p>This buoyancy freed cephalopods from the constraints of their heavy shells, allowing them to reach stupendous sizes. No matter how big the shell grew, its weight was automatically offset by more gas-filled chambers.</p>

<p><em>Endoceras giganteum</em>, for example, grew up to 3.5 meters, longer than a basketball hoop is tall. It was the biggest animal the world had yet seen. I feel confident calling this 450-million-year-old beast one of the planet&rsquo;s first monsters.</p>
<p>But how did we get from <em>Endoceras</em> to <em>Architeuthis</em>? Is one a direct ancestor of the other, or are they distant cousins n-times-removed? And what became of that fantastic shell?</p>
<p>We need a family tree for <em>Endoceras</em>, <em>Architeuthis</em>, and everything in between&mdash;in other words, a cephalopod phylogeny. For over a century, scientists have been working to reconstruct such a phylogeny with evidence from fossils, embryos, DNA and more. I made an attempt to synthesize the most recent work into a single drawing, with lots of advice from paleontologists and the helping hand of an artist who polished my messy sketchwork (and put in those friendly eyes).</p>

Clark</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Endoceras</em> was one of the Orthocerida, which you can find down in the Ordovician, in the lower right. Today&rsquo;s giant squid take pride of place&mdash;with their smaller siblings&mdash;top and center. As for the rest&hellip;</p>
<p>From Cambrian through Silurian times, cephalopods all wore their shells on the outside of their bodies, just like every other self-respecting mollusk. The nautiloids continued that decorous habit to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">present day</a>. Another externally-shelled group, the ammonoids, explored every bizarre baroque extreme of shell coiling and ornamentation before getting mass-extincted alongside the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>What remains are the coleoids&mdash;the only group of cephalopods in which evolution sheathed the shell, burying hard structure inside a soft body.</p>
<p>At first, this internal shell was still massive and still full of buoyant chambers, as in the early coleoid <em>Hematites</em>. But over time natural selection (carried out by hungry fish, for the most part) favored smaller, simpler shells.</p>
<div><img src="http://www.deepseanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/4cover_fossil-600x481.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="481" srcset="http://www.deepseanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/4cover_fossil-600x481.jpg 600w, http://www.deepseanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/4cover_fossil-150x120.jpg 150w, http://www.deepseanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/4cover_fossil-300x241.jpg 300w, http://www.deepseanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/4cover_fossil-768x616.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><p>Fossil Squid; credit: Diego Sala.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, <a href="http://tolweb.org/Sepioidea/23870" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cuttlefish</a> and <a href="http://tolweb.org/Spirula_spirula/148171" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ram&rsquo;s horn squid</a> are the only modern coleoids to retain the hard calcium and buoyant chambers of their ancestors. The internal shells of octopuses have evolved into mere vestiges.</p>
<p>And squid? Well, the shell remnant of a squid has no chambers and no calcium. But it runs the full length of the body, from head to fin-tip, and it offers support to the powerful muscles that carry these modern monsters through the sea. Though unarmored, <em>Architeuthis</em> is most likely faster and far more agile than <em>Endoceras</em> could ever have dreamed of being.</p>
<p>So which one would you rather meet in a dark alley?</p>]]></content>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>New open data licenses make it easier for individuals and organizations of all types to share, analyze and use data collaboratively </em></p>
<p><strong>PRAGUE (OPEN SOURCE SUMMIT EUROPE 2017), October 23, 2017 &ndash; </strong>The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit advancing <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">professional open source</a> management for mass collaboration, today announced the <a href="https://www.cdla.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Community Data License Agreement</a> (CDLA) family of open data agreements. In an era of expansive and often underused data, the CDLA licenses are an effort to define a licensing framework to support collaborative communities built around curating and sharing &ldquo;open&rdquo; data.</p>
<p>Inspired by the collaborative software development models of open source software, the CDLA licenses are designed to enable individuals and organizations of all types to share data as easily as they currently share open source software code. Soundly drafted licensing models can help people form communities to assemble, curate and maintain vast amounts of data, measured in petabytes and exabytes, to bring new value to communities of all types, to build new business opportunities and to power new applications that promise to enhance safety and services.</p>
<p>The growth of big data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has allowed people to extract unprecedented levels of insight from data. Now the challenge is to assemble the critical mass of data for those tools to analyze. The CDLA licenses are designed to help governments, academic institutions, businesses and other organizations open up and share data, with the goal of creating communities that curate and share data openly.</p>
<p>For instance, if automakers, suppliers and civil infrastructure services can share data, they may be able to improve safety, decrease energy consumption and improve predictive maintenance. Self-driving cars are heavily dependent on AI systems for navigation, and need massive volumes of data to function properly. Once on the road, they can generate nearly a gigabyte of data every second. For the average car, that means two petabytes of sensor, audio, video and other data each year.</p>
<p>Similarly, climate modeling can integrate measurements captured by government agencies with simulation data from other organizations and then use machine learning systems to look for patterns in the information. <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/how-machine-learning-could-help-to-improve-climate-forecasts-1.22503" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">It&rsquo;s estimated that</a> a single model can yield a petabyte of data, a volume that challenges standard computer algorithms, but is useful for machine learning systems. This knowledge may help improve agriculture or aid in studying extreme weather patterns.</p>
<p>And if government agencies share aggregated data on building permits, school enrollment figures, sewer and water usage, their citizens benefit from the ability of commercial entities to anticipate their future needs and respond with infrastructure and facilities that arrive in anticipation of citizens&rsquo; demands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An open data license is essential for the frictionless sharing of the data that powers both critical technologies and societal benefits,&rdquo; said Jim Zemlin, Executive Director of The Linux Foundation. &ldquo;The success of open source software provides a powerful example of what can be accomplished when people come together around a resource and advance it for the common good. The CDLA licenses are a key step in that direction and will encourage the continued growth of applications and infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>CDLA Licenses Promote Sharing While Reducing Risk</strong></p>
<p>The Linux Foundation, in collaboration with a broad set of participating organizations, drafted the CDLA licenses with the needs of companies, organizations and communities that have valuable data assets such as these to share. The intention of the licenses is for contributors and consumers of open datasets to actively use and support the contribution of data in a uniform fashion, while clarifying the terms of that sharing and reducing risk.</p>
<p>There are two CDLA licenses: a Sharing license that encourages contributions of data back to the data community and a Permissive license that puts no additional sharing requirements on recipients or contributors of open data. Both encourage and facilitate the productive use of data. A few commercial and community implications of the licenses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data producers can share with greater clarity about what recipients may do with it. Data producers can also choose between Sharing and Permissive licenses and select the model that best aligns with their interests. In either case, data producers should enjoy the clarity of recognized terms and disclaimers of liabilities and warranties.</li>
<li>Data communities can standardize on a license or set of licenses that provide the ability to share data on known, equal terms that balance the needs of data producers and data users. Data communities have a high degree of flexibility to add their own governance and requirements for curating data as a community, particularly around areas such as personally identifiable information.</li>
<li>Data users who are looking for datasets to help kick off training an AI system or for any other use will have the ability to find data shared under a known license model with terms that clearly state their rights and responsibilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CDLA is data privacy agnostic and relies on the publisher and curators of the data to create their own governance structure around what data they curate and how. Each producer or curator of data will have to work through various jurisdictional requirements and legal issues.</p>
<p><strong>Broad Support for the CDLA</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Data is the oil of the 21st century,&rdquo; said Mark Radcliffe, Partner and Global Chair of the FOSS Practice Group at DLA Piper. &ldquo;Yet, the legal protection for and licensing of data is in its infancy. Many current licenses take a variety of inconsistent (and frequently incomplete) approaches to the use and licensing of data.&nbsp;The CDLA provides a valuable tool for companies and lawyers in managing the use and licensing of data.&nbsp;In the best tradition of the open source community, The Linux Foundation used a collaborative process to get the best possible agreement.&nbsp;I will be using the CDLA for many of my clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We see the CDLA as being in the forefront of encouraging a shift in how people view data,&rdquo; said Todd Moore, Vice President, Open Technology at IBM. &ldquo;Given the growing volume of available datasets, data by itself is no longer the primary source of value. Instead, the ecosystem around the development and mining of trends and insights derived from data holds far more value for society. The CDLA provides the right platform to enable this shift in view and we are excited to be an early adopter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Data is replacing concrete as the foundation of 21<sup>st</sup> century transportation, and knitting this increasingly complex array of public and private data sources together requires new approaches to data licensing and data governance,&rdquo; said Kevin Webb, Executive Director, Open Transport Partnership. &ldquo;The CDLA provides a critical new tool to facilitate collaboration and data sharing between government and private sector innovators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shared data licensing will do for machine learning and the next phase of information technology evolution what the GNU General Public License and the free software ethos it embodied did for primary software production over the last generation,&rdquo; said Eben Moglen, Professor of Law at Columbia Law School and founding director of the Software Freedom Law Center.&nbsp;&ldquo;Clearly expressed, well-designed rules for &lsquo;share alike&rsquo; treatment of collaboratively-produced data will enable massive cooperation and help us resist over-concentrated ownership of the resource most crucial to 21st century social and economic development.&rdquo;</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p pid="6">To gather insights on the state of web application development today, we spoke with 12 executives who are familiar with the current state of the industry and asked them, "What&rsquo;s the future of web applications from your point of view - where do the greatest opportunities lie?" Here's what they told us:</p> 
<h2 pid="12">Collaboration</h2> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>Collaborative development tools.</strong> Currently, web-based collaboration ends at the mockup phase. We see room for technologies that allow a team to collaboratively develop an application up to the point of implementing multiple screens and transitions, data entry and validation rules, conditionally shown components, simple workflows, and other standard interactions, *before* developers go into an IDE and start writing code.</li> 
 <li>Capabilities with APIs, <strong>smooth UX, web platforms consistent across devices with the realization that there will be more devices.</strong>&nbsp;UI/UX testing with Selenium. Make it as simple as possible. Despite the complexity, at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s still an HTTP request and response in a simple Perl application.&nbsp;</li> 
 <li><strong>We&rsquo;ll get better at&nbsp;cross-platform.</strong>&nbsp;Ultimately, we&rsquo;ll have frameworks that enable us to build once and run everywhere but we&rsquo;ll start with the lowest common denominator which won&rsquo;t make anyone happy. Web applications will not go away though they may become industry specific.&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>The ability to coordinate all of the different variables that can affect web applications to&nbsp;<strong>ensure they are synchronized before they are presented to the end user</strong>.&nbsp;Automated deployment and visual testing and monitoring&nbsp;supports&nbsp;the entire digital transformation.&nbsp;</li> 
 <li><strong>Building apps to serve end users.</strong>&nbsp;Provide a great UX wherever and whenever the user wants to interact. Banks have realized the need to do this. New interfaces with phones, Alexa, and Siri. 67% of apps are gone after one use. Make sure the engagement is simple and the performance is good. Recognize the business goals before developing a new app versus tuning an existing app. Analyze where the app is failing and how much it is hurting your business. Know how the app is performing for each user.</li> 
</ul> 
<h2 pid="13">Other</h2> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>API first.</strong> Everything is backed by a public facing API. No breaking changes as we move forward. Smoother accomplishment of the goal of plugging email into the enterprise system easily.</li> 
 <li>There are opportunities in certain sectors, like retail, to <strong>leverage AR and VR</strong>. Experiences will be more immersive. This will increase the motivation and attack vectors for hackers. The only way to catch up is with automation, orchestration, and AI.</li> 
 <li><strong>Progressive web application technology.</strong> The web app experience is the same as the native app experience without the negative drawbacks. The barrier to entry is development and installation. Emerging technologies are being adopted by the browsers. This will free developers from platforms and app stores.</li> 
 <li>Orchestration with IDE more and more as add-on functions to third-party applications like Salesforce. <strong>Incrementally adding things to what customers are already using.</strong></li> 
 <li>Web applications are becoming common as the internet matures. To stay relevant as technology evolves it becomes imperative to increase intelligence. <strong>Applications that implement machine learning to understand the patterns of their users</strong> hold significant potential for maintaining usefulness, enhancing the user experience, and providing growth potential.</li> 
 <li><strong>Making microservices&nbsp;with better integration</strong> with other systems moving beyond self-hosted to cloud-hosted so they can scale. Stronger standards for REST.</li> 
 <li>Nobody knows for sure where the future of web applications lies -- whether it&rsquo;s voice controls, chatbots, artificial intelligence, AngularJS, ReactJS, or augmented reality. <strong>By choosing a model-driven platform, you can future-proof your web application development effort</strong>, adopt new technologies easily, and own the future &ndash; whatever it brings.</li> 
</ul> 
<p pid="2">What do you see as the future of web application development?</p>]]></content>

	<title type="html">MIT neuroscientists build case for new theory of memory formation</title>
	<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Learning and memory are generally thought to be composed of three major steps: encoding events into ...</p>]]></summary>
	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Learning and memory are generally thought to be composed of three major steps: encoding events into the brain network, storing the encoded information, and later retrieving it for recall.</p>



<p>Two years ago, MIT neuroscientists discovered that under certain types of retrograde amnesia, memories of a particular event could be stored in the brain even though they could not be retrieved through natural recall cues. This phenomenon suggests that existing models of memory formation need to be revised, as the researchers propose in a new paper in which they further detail how these &ldquo;silent engrams&rdquo; are formed and re-activated.</p>



<p>The researchers believe their findings offer evidence that memory storage does not rely on the strengthening of connections, or &ldquo;synapses,&rdquo; between memory cells, as has long been thought. Instead, a pattern of connections that form between these cells during the first few minutes after an event occurs are sufficient to store a memory.</p>



<p>&ldquo;One of our main conclusions in this study is that a specific memory is stored in a specific pattern of connectivity between engram cell ensembles that lie along an anatomical pathway. This conclusion is provocative because the dogma has been that a memory is instead stored by synaptic strength,&rdquo; says Susumu Tonegawa, the Picower Professor of Biology and Neuroscience, the director of the RIKEN-MIT Center for Neural Circuit Genetics at the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, and the study&rsquo;s senior author.</p>



<p>The researchers also showed that even though memories held by silent engrams cannot be naturally recalled, the memories persist for at least a week and can be &ldquo;awakened&rdquo; days later by treating cells with a protein that stimulates synapse formation.</p>



<p>Dheeraj Roy, a recent MIT PhD recipient, is the lead author of the paper, which appears in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> the week of Oct. 23. Other authors are MIT postdoc Shruti Muralidhar and technical associate Lillian Smith.</p>



<p><strong>Silent memories</strong></p>



<p>Neuroscientists have long believed that memories of events are stored when synaptic connections, which allow neurons to communicate with each other, are strengthened. Previous studies have found that if synthesis of certain cellular proteins is blocked in mice immediately after an event occurs, the mice will have no long-term memory of the event.</p>



<p>However, in a 2015 paper, <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2015/optogenetics-find-lost-memories-0528" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tonegawa and his colleagues showed</a> for the first time that memories could be stored even when synthesis of the cellular proteins is blocked. They found that while the mice could not recall those memories in response to natural cues, such as being placed in the cage where a fearful event took place, the memories were still there and could be artificially retrieved using a technique known as optogenetics.</p>



<p>The researchers have dubbed these memory cells &ldquo;silent engrams,&rdquo; and they have since found that these engrams can also be formed in other situations. In a study of mice with symptoms that mimic early Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, the <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/retrieve-missing-memories-early-alzheimers-symptoms-0316" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researchers found</a> that while the mice had trouble recalling memories, those memories still existed and could be optogenetically retrieved.</p>



<p>In a more recent study of a process called systems consolidation of memory, the <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/neuroscientists-identify-brain-circuit-necessary-memory-formation-0406" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researchers found engrams</a> in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex that encoded the same memory. However, the prefrontal cortex engrams were silent for about two weeks after the memory was initially encoded, while the hippocampal engrams were active right away. Over time, the memory in the prefrontal cortex became active, while the hippocampal engram slowly became silent.</p>



<p>In their new <em>PNAS</em> study, the researchers investigated further how these silent engrams are formed, how long they last, and how they can be re-activated.</p>



<p>Similar to their original 2015 study, they trained mice to fear being placed in a certain cage, by delivering a mild foot shock. After this training, the mice freeze when placed back in that cage. As the mice were trained, their memory cells were labeled with a light-sensitive protein that allows the cells to be re-activated with light. The researchers also inhibited the synthesis of cellular proteins immediately after the training occurred.</p>



<p>They found that after the training, the mice did not react when placed back in the cage where the training took place. However, the mice did freeze when the memory cells were activated with laser light while the animals were in a cage that should not have had any fearful associations. These silent memories could be activated by laser light for up to eight days after the original training.</p>



<p><strong>Making connections</strong></p>



<p>The findings offer support for Tonegawa&rsquo;s new hypothesis that the strengthening of synaptic connections, while necessary for a memory to be initially encoded, is not necessary for its subsequent long-term storage. Instead, he proposes that memories are stored in the specific pattern of connections formed between engram cell ensembles. These connections, which form very rapidly during encoding, are distinct from the synaptic strengthening that occurs later (within a few hours of the event) with the help of protein synthesis.</p>



<p>&ldquo;What we are saying is that even without new cellular protein synthesis, once a new connection is made, or a pre-existing connection is strengthened during encoding, that new pattern of connections is maintained,&rdquo; Tonegawa says. &ldquo;Even if you cannot induce natural memory recall, the memory information is still there.&rdquo;</p>



<p>This raised a question about the purpose of the post-encoding protein synthesis. Considering that silent engrams are not retrieved by natural cues, the researchers believe the primary purpose of the protein synthesis is to enable natural recall cues to do their job efficiently.</p>



<p>The researchers also tried to reactivate the silent engrams by treating the mice with a protein called PAK1, which promotes the formation of synapses. They found that this treatment, given two days after the original event took place, was enough to grow new synapses between engram cells. A few days after the treatment, mice whose ability to recall the memory had been blocked initially would freeze after being placed in the cage where the training took place. Furthermore, their reaction was just as strong as that of mice whose memories had been formed with no interference.</p>



<p>Sheena Josselyn, an associate professor of psychology and physiology at the University of Toronto, said the findings run counter to the longstanding idea that memory formation involves strengthening of synapses between neurons and that this process requires protein synthesis.</p>



<p>&ldquo;They showed that a memory formed during protein-synthesis inhibition may be artificially (but not naturally) recalled. That is, the memory is still retained in the brain without protein synthesis, but this memory cannot be accessed under normal conditions, suggesting that spines may not be the key keepers of information,&rdquo; says Josselyn, who was not involved in the research. &ldquo;The findings are controversial, but many paradigm-shifting papers are.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Along with the researchers&rsquo; previous findings on silent engrams in early Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, this study suggests that re-activating certain synapses could help restore some memory recall function in patients with early stage Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, Roy says.</p>



<p>The research was funded by the RIKEN Brain Science Institute, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and the JPB Foundation.</p>]]></content>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(<i>Geological Society of America</i>) When the Chicxulub asteroid slammed into Earth about 66 million years ago, it obliterated 80 percent of Earth's species, blasted out a crater 200 kilometers across, and signaled an abrupt end to the Cretaceous Period. The impact, its catastrophic effects, and its aftermath have engrossed scientists and the public alike since it was first discovered.</p>]]></content>

	<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Limited Space in Singapore

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Limited Space in Singapore</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://futurism.com/smart-city-singapore-going-get-smarter/?src=featured" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">city-state of Singapore</a> has announced a plan to reduce the vehicle growth rate from 0.25 percent per year to 0 percent for cars and motorcycles. Due to the limited space available, Singapore controls the number of vehicles on the road to a great degree.</p>
<p>The Land Transport Authority (LTA) issues permits, known as Certificates of Entitlement, that give vehicle owners the right to have their vehicle for a period of ten years. The permits are auctioned off. The last auction ended with the highest bidder paying $41,617 (US $30,533.39) only for the privilege&nbsp;of being able to operate the vehicle.</p>
<p>The government cites the limited available&nbsp;land area as a reason behind the halt. The LTA stated, &ldquo;In view of land constraints and competing needs, there is limited scope for further expansion of the road network.&rdquo; Roads currently take up twelve percent of the city&rsquo;s total land area. There are more than 600,000 private and rental cars on this limited road space. The growth rate for commercial vehicles will remain at 0.25 percent.</p>

<h2>Climate Change</h2>
<p>The restriction on new cars will make it even more difficult to own a car in Singapore, which remains one of the most expensive places to own a vehicle. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-bitcoin-institutional/big-money-stays-away-from-booming-bitcoin-idUSKBN1CS0EB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to <em>Reuters</em></a>, mid-range vehicles can cost more than four times the price of the same vehicle in the U.S.<figure><a href="https://futurism.com/images/flying-cars-of-tomorrow-infographic/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="https://futurism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Homepage-Thumbnail-7-900x600.jpg" alt="Flying Cars: A Future Buyer&rsquo;s Guide [Infographic]"></a><figcaption><strong><a href="https://futurism.com/images/flying-cars-of-tomorrow-infographic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click to View Full Infographic</a></strong></figcaption></figure>
</p><p>However, increased restriction on vehicle ownership will have some positive side effects, at least in terms of environmental impact. Less cars on the roads of Singapore&nbsp;will mean less pollution for fossil fuel burning engines. Also, halting the expansion of the roads system in the country will prevent further transportation development of natural spaces. Even without expansion, not adding new vehicles will prevent the current system from becoming overcrowded, also preventing <a href="https://futurism.com/smog-in-parts-of-the-u-s-comes-from-air-pollution-in-asia/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">environmentally&nbsp;harmful</a> gridlock.</p>
<p>The new restrictions will not impact the number of permits available. The LTA will re-evaluate the policy for cars and motorcycles in 2020 and for commercial vehicles in March of 2021.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Deadly Pollution</h2>
<p>We all know that pollution, in general, is harmful to human health. But a study <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32345-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published in <em>T</em></a><i><a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32345-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he Lancet&nbsp;</a></i>has shown the true magnitude of the threat. According to the study, in 2015, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/609182/pollution-causes-9-million-premature-deaths-a-year/?utm_campaign=Owned+Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;utm_medium=Owned+Social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 in every 6 deaths around the world</a> were caused by toxic air, water, soil, or workplace environment. That&rsquo;s roughly 9 million people. To drive home the true weight of these figures, this means that pollution kills three times more people annually than tuberculosis, AIDS, or malaria.</p>
<p>Of these<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-pollution/study-links-pollution-to-millions-of-deaths-worldwide-idUSKBN1CO39B" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 9 million annual deaths</a>, 92% occur in less wealthy nations, signaling an obvious socioeconomic divide. Developing economies have the financial burden of fighting the causes of pollution (the welfare-linked costs of which are estimated to be roughly $4.6 trillion a year) while at the same time handling its repercussions. This problem will only continue to grow unless broader interventions are put in place &mdash; as the countries most greatly affected cannot afford to take major action on their own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pollution is much more than an environmental challenge &ndash; it is a profound and pervasive threat that affects many aspects of human health and wellbeing,&rdquo; said Philip Landrigan, a&nbsp;professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who co-led the study.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Drastic Consequences</h2>
<p>The study,&nbsp;published this past Friday, was conducted by about 40 international scientists. They used data from the Global Burden of Disease study and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. It is clear from the study that not only is pollution a deadly, global issue, but there is clear division between wealthier and poorer countries. According to the study, pollution causes approximately 16% of all deaths worldwide&nbsp;&mdash; a figure that is 15 times larger than deaths caused by war and violence. And, while this figure is staggering worldwide, when you take a closer look at more-affected countries, that figure could jump to 25%.</p>
<p>Besides&nbsp;causing the deaths of millions, pollution has also been affecting our planet in other ways: <a href="https://futurism.com/pollution-from-ships-is-causing-lightning-storms-over-ocean-shipping-lanes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it has even sparked lightning storms.&nbsp;</a>There are a number of ways that people are looking to combat this serious issue. An obvious way in which pollution can be battled is through legislation. China is taking this effort seriously,<a href="https://futurism.com/its-official-china-is-launching-a-war-on-pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> as&nbsp; 1.1 million people die in the country annually </a>as a result of pollution. China is also investing 3 trillion yuan ($440 billion) in incentive programs and credit mechanisms for businesses that will shift priorities toward producing less emissions.</p>
<p>In addition to government-backed programs, there are some who are using technological innovation to fight the battle:<a href="https://futurism.com/a-tiny-device-can-transform-air-pollution-into-usable-fuel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> One group of scientists has even developed a device </a>that turns air pollution into usable fuel. If we&rsquo;re going to get serious about fighting pollution on a global scale, we&rsquo;ll need more intensive methods. It is not a slow-moving issue that can be thought of occasionally and worked at on a small scale. It is a problem that&rsquo;s already proven deadly, requiring direct and immediate action.</p>

Every year, more people are killed by pollutants &mdash; from toxic air to contaminated water &mdash; than by all <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/war" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">war</a> and violence. Pollution is also responsible for more deaths than AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined.

Scientists determined that one out of every six premature deaths (about 9 million in 2015) results from pollution; and while life is more important than money, these deaths cause $4.6 trillion in annual losses or about 6.2 percent of the world&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p><img src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/study-finds-pollution-more-deadly-than-all-war-and-violence-1-889x592.jpg" alt="AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, environment, pollution, Lancet medical journal, science, News, environmental destruction, air pollution, war, violence, poverty,"></p>
<p>Epidemiologist Philip Landrigan, lead author and Dean of global health at the Icahn School of Medicine in New York, said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a lot of study of pollution, but it&rsquo;s never received the resources or level of attention as, say, AIDS or <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">climate change.</a>&rdquo; Landrigan added that pollution is a &ldquo;massive problem&rdquo; few truly comprehend, as what they&rsquo;re witnessing are &ldquo;scattered bits of it.&rdquo; This is the first study of its kind to take into account data on all <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/disease" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">diseases</a> and death caused by pollution combined.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://phys.org/journals/lancet/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a>, developing countries &mdash; primarily in Asia and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/Africa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Africa</a> &mdash; are putting the most people at risk due to a lack of air and soil pollution monitoring systems. In 2015, one out of four (2.5 million) premature deaths in <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/India" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">India</a> and one out of five (1.8 million) premature deaths in China were caused by pollution-related illness. &ldquo;In the West, we got the lead out of the gasoline, so we thought lead was handled. We got rid of the burning rivers, cleaned up the worst of the toxic sites. And then all of those discussions went into the background,&rdquo; said Richard Fuller, head of the Pure Earth and one of the 47 scientists who contributed to the report. In <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/Bangladesh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bangladesh</a>, Pakistan, North Korea, South Sudan and Haiti, nearly one-fifth of premature deaths are pollution-related.</p>
<p><img src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/study-finds-pollution-more-deadly-than-all-war-and-violence-3-889x582.jpg" alt="AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, environment, pollution, Lancet medical journal, science, News, environmental destruction, air pollution, war, violence, poverty,"></p>
<p>Based on this information, it should not come as a surprise that the poorest suffer most from pollution-related illness. 92 percent of sickness related to <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/environment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">environmental</a> toxicity occurs in low- or middle-income countries. <a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-10-world-pollution-deadlier-wars-disasters.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Phys</a> reports, &ldquo;Environmental regulations in those countries tend to be weaker, and industries lean on outdated technologies and dirtier fuels.&rdquo; Fuller noted that this safety of the public is being compromised for industrial growth, which has negative repercussions. He said, &ldquo;What people don&rsquo;t realize is that pollution does damage to <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/economy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">economies</a>. People who are sick or dead cannot contribute to the economy. They need to be looked after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To determine the global impact of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/air-pollution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pollution</a>, the study&rsquo;s authors used methods outlined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for assessing field data from soil tests, in addition to air and water pollution data from the Global Burden of Disease. Though 9 million pollution-related deaths is a &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; estimate, it is still 15 times the number of people killed in war or other forms of violence, and six times the number killed in <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/green-transportation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">road accidents</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/study-finds-pollution-more-deadly-than-all-war-and-violence-2-889x591.jpg" alt="AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, environment, pollution, Lancet medical journal, science, News, environmental destruction, air pollution, war, violence, poverty,"></p>
<p>Ernesto Sanchez-Triana, the&nbsp;lead environmental specialist at the World Bank, said, &ldquo;The relationship between pollution and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/poverty" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poverty</a> is very clear. And controlling pollution would help us address many other problems, from climate change to <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/malnutrition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">malnutrition</a>. The linkages can&rsquo;t be ignored.&rdquo;</p>

Although changes in Hurricane Irma's path spared Florida from the bulk of the damage, both Irma and Maria directly hit Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Hurricane Maria was particularly devastating for the more than 3.5 million American citizens living in these U.S. Caribbean territories.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>New research suggests that the boundary between South American tropical rainforests and savannas is influenced by the depth to which plants can root. Shallow rooting depth promotes the establishment of savannas. Previous research has shown that precipitation and fire mediate tropical forest and savanna distributions. The study shows that below ground conditions need to be considered to understand the distribution of terrestrial vegetation both historically and in the face of future climate change. The study by researchers of the Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre and Goethe University is based on computer vegetation models and was published in Journal of Biogeography.</p>]]></content>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Humanity is producing data at an unimaginable rate, to the point that storage technologies can&rsquo;t keep up. Every five years, the amount of data we&rsquo;re producing increases&nbsp;<a href="https://www.emc.com/leadership/digital-universe/index.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10-fold</a>, including photos and videos. Not all of it needs to be stored, but manufacturers of data storage aren&rsquo;t making hard drives and flash chips fast enough to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seagate.com/our-story/data-age-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hold what we do want to keep</a>. Since we&rsquo;re not going to stop taking pictures and recording movies, we need to develop new ways to save them.</p>
<p>Over millennia, nature has evolved an incredible information storage medium &ndash; DNA. It evolved to store genetic information, blueprints for building proteins, but DNA can be used for many more purposes than just that. DNA is also much denser than modern storage media: The data on hundreds of thousands of DVDs could fit inside a&nbsp;<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11875" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">matchbox-size package of DNA</a>. DNA is also much more durable &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.201411378" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lasting thousands of years</a>&nbsp;&ndash; than today&rsquo;s hard drives, which may last&nbsp;<a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/170748-how-long-do-hard-drives-actually-live-for" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">years or decades</a>. And while hard drive formats and connection standards become obsolete, DNA never will, at least so long as there&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>The idea of storing digital data in DNA is&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">several decades old</a>, but recent work from&nbsp;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1226355" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Harvard</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11875" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">European Bioinformatics Institute</a>&nbsp;showed that progress in modern DNA manipulation methods could make it both possible and practical today. Many research groups, including at the&nbsp;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.201411378" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ETH Zurich</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep14138" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aaj2038" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>&nbsp;are working on this problem. Our&nbsp;<a href="http://misl.cs.washington.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">own group</a>&nbsp;at the University of Washington and Microsoft&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2016/07/07/uw-microsoft-researchers-break-record-for-dna-data-storage/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">holds the world record</a>&nbsp;for the amount of data successfully stored in and retrieved from DNA &ndash; 200 megabytes.</p>
<p><strong>Preparing bits to become atoms</strong></p>
<p>Traditional media like hard drives, thumb drives or DVDs store digital data by changing either the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/88078-how-a-hard-drive-works" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">magnetic</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/flash-memory.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">electrical</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1820962,00.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">optical properties</a>&nbsp;of a material to store 0s and 1s.</p>
<p>To store data in DNA, the concept is the same, but the process is different. DNA molecules are long sequences of smaller molecules, called nucleotides &ndash; adenine, cytosine, thymine and guanine, usually designated as A, C, T and G. Rather than creating sequences of 0s and 1s, as in electronic media, DNA storage uses sequences of the nucleotides.</p>
<p>There are several ways to do this, but the general idea is to assign digital data patterns to DNA nucleotides. For instance, 00 could be equivalent to A, 01 to C, 10 to T and 11 to G. To store a picture, for example, we start with its encoding as a digital file, like a JPEG. That file is, in essence, a long string of 0s and 1s. Let&rsquo;s say the first eight bits of the file are 01111000; we break them into pairs &ndash; 01 11 10 00 &ndash; which correspond to C-G-T-A. That&rsquo;s the order in which we join the nucleotides to form a DNA strand.</p>
<p>Digital computer files can be quite large &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/332069/what-is-a-realistic-real-world-maximum-size-for-a-sqlite-database" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">even terabytes in size for large databases</a>. But individual DNA strands have to be much shorter &ndash; holding only about 20 bytes each. That&rsquo;s because the longer a DNA strand is, the harder it is to build chemically.</p>
<p>So we need to break the data into smaller chunks, and add to each an indicator of where in the sequence it falls. When it&rsquo;s time to read the DNA-stored information, that indicator will ensure all the chunks of data stay in their proper order.</p>
<p>Now we have a plan for how to store the data. Next we have to actually do it.</p>
<p><strong>Storing the data</strong></p>
<p>After determining what order the letters should go in, the DNA sequences are manufactured letter by letter with chemical reactions. These reactions are driven by equipment that takes in bottles of A&rsquo;s, C&rsquo;s, G&rsquo;s and T&rsquo;s and mixes them in a liquid solution with other chemicals to control the reactions that specify the order of the physical DNA strands.</p>
<p>This process brings us another benefit of DNA storage: backup copies. Rather than making one strand at a time, the chemical reactions make many identical strands at once, before going on to make many copies of the next strand in the series.</p>
<p>Once the DNA strands are created, we need to protect them against damage from&nbsp;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.201411378" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">humidity and light</a>. So we dry them out and put them in a container that keeps them cold and blocks water and light.</p>
<p>But stored data are useful only if we can retrieve them later.</p>
<p><strong>Reading the data back</strong></p>
<p>To read the data back out of storage, we use a sequencing machine exactly like those used for analysis of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">genomic DNA in cells</a>. This identifies the molecules, generating a letter sequence per molecule, which we then decode into a binary sequence of 0s and 1s in order. This process can destroy the DNA as it is read &ndash; but that&rsquo;s where those backup copies come into play: There are many copies of each sequence.</p>
<p>And if the backup copies get depleted, it is easy to make duplicate copies to refill the storage &ndash; just as nature&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">copies DNA all the time</a>.</p>
<p>At the moment, most DNA retrieval systems require reading all of the information stored in a particular container, even if we want only a small amount of it. This is like reading an entire hard drive&rsquo;s worth of information just to find one email message. We have developed techniques &ndash; based on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1700278" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">well-studied biochemistry methods</a>&nbsp;&ndash; that let us&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/114553" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">identify and read</a>&nbsp;only the&nbsp;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2872362.2872397" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">specific pieces of information</a>&nbsp;a user needs to retrieve from DNA storage.</p>
<p><strong>Remaining challenges</strong></p>
<p>At present, DNA storage is experimental. Before it becomes commonplace, it needs to be completely automated, and the processes of both building DNA and reading it must be improved. They are both prone to error and relatively slow. For example, today&rsquo;s DNA synthesis lets us write a few&nbsp;<a href="https://synbiobeta.com/time-new-dna-synthesis-sequencing-cost-curves-rob-carlson/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundred bytes per second</a>; a modern hard drive can write&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-read-and-write-speeds-2640236" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundreds of millions of bytes per second</a>. An average iPhone photo would take several hours to store in DNA, though it takes less than a second to save on the phone or transfer to a computer.</p>
<p>These are significant challenges, but we are optimistic because all the relevant technologies are improving rapidly. Further, DNA data storage doesn&rsquo;t need the perfect accuracy that biology requires, so researchers are likely to find even cheaper and faster ways to store information in nature&rsquo;s oldest data storage system.</p>
