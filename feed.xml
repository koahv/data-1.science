	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Deadly Pollution</h2>
<p>We all know that pollution, in general, is harmful to human health. But a study <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32345-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published in <em>T</em></a><i><a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32345-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he Lancet&nbsp;</a></i>has shown the true magnitude of the threat. According to the study, in 2015, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/609182/pollution-causes-9-million-premature-deaths-a-year/?utm_campaign=Owned+Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;utm_medium=Owned+Social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 in every 6 deaths around the world</a> were caused by toxic air, water, soil, or workplace environment. That&rsquo;s roughly 9 million people. To drive home the true weight of these figures, this means that pollution kills three times more people annually than tuberculosis, AIDS, or malaria.</p>
<p>Of these<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-pollution/study-links-pollution-to-millions-of-deaths-worldwide-idUSKBN1CO39B" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 9 million annual deaths</a>, 92% occur in less wealthy nations, signaling an obvious socioeconomic divide. Developing economies have the financial burden of fighting the causes of pollution (the welfare-linked costs of which are estimated to be roughly $4.6 trillion a year) while at the same time handling its repercussions. This problem will only continue to grow unless broader interventions are put in place &mdash; as the countries most greatly affected cannot afford to take major action on their own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pollution is much more than an environmental challenge &ndash; it is a profound and pervasive threat that affects many aspects of human health and wellbeing,&rdquo; said Philip Landrigan, a&nbsp;professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who co-led the study.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Drastic Consequences</h2>
<p>The study,&nbsp;published this past Friday, was conducted by about 40 international scientists. They used data from the Global Burden of Disease study and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. It is clear from the study that not only is pollution a deadly, global issue, but there is clear division between wealthier and poorer countries. According to the study, pollution causes approximately 16% of all deaths worldwide&nbsp;&mdash; a figure that is 15 times larger than deaths caused by war and violence. And, while this figure is staggering worldwide, when you take a closer look at more-affected countries, that figure could jump to 25%.</p>
<p>Besides&nbsp;causing the deaths of millions, pollution has also been affecting our planet in other ways: <a href="https://futurism.com/pollution-from-ships-is-causing-lightning-storms-over-ocean-shipping-lanes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it has even sparked lightning storms.&nbsp;</a>There are a number of ways that people are looking to combat this serious issue. An obvious way in which pollution can be battled is through legislation. China is taking this effort seriously,<a href="https://futurism.com/its-official-china-is-launching-a-war-on-pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> as&nbsp; 1.1 million people die in the country annually </a>as a result of pollution. China is also investing 3 trillion yuan ($440 billion) in incentive programs and credit mechanisms for businesses that will shift priorities toward producing less emissions.</p>
<p>In addition to government-backed programs, there are some who are using technological innovation to fight the battle:<a href="https://futurism.com/a-tiny-device-can-transform-air-pollution-into-usable-fuel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> One group of scientists has even developed a device </a>that turns air pollution into usable fuel. If we&rsquo;re going to get serious about fighting pollution on a global scale, we&rsquo;ll need more intensive methods. It is not a slow-moving issue that can be thought of occasionally and worked at on a small scale. It is a problem that&rsquo;s already proven deadly, requiring direct and immediate action.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img fl:hint-main-image="true" src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/study-finds-pollution-more-deadly-than-all-war-and-violence-1-889x592.jpg" alt="AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, environment, pollution, Lancet medical journal, science, News, environmental destruction, air pollution, war, violence, poverty,"></p>
<p>Environmental <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/pollution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pollution</a> isn&rsquo;t just inconvenient, it&rsquo;s also deadly. Every year, more people are killed by pollutants &mdash; from toxic air to contaminated water &mdash; than by all <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/war" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">war</a> and violence. Pollution is also responsible for more deaths than AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined. This disturbing revelation was revealed in a new study published in the <a href="https://phys.org/journals/lancet/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lancet </a>medical journal. Scientists determined that one out of every six premature deaths (about 9 million in 2015) results from pollution; and while life is more important than money, these deaths cause $4.6 trillion in annual losses or about 6.2 percent of the world&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p><img src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/study-finds-pollution-more-deadly-than-all-war-and-violence-1-889x592.jpg" alt="AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, environment, pollution, Lancet medical journal, science, News, environmental destruction, air pollution, war, violence, poverty,"></p>
<p>Epidemiologist Philip Landrigan, lead author and Dean of global health at the Icahn School of Medicine in New York, said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a lot of study of pollution, but it&rsquo;s never received the resources or level of attention as, say, AIDS or <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">climate change.</a>&rdquo; Landrigan added that pollution is a &ldquo;massive problem&rdquo; few truly comprehend, as what they&rsquo;re witnessing are &ldquo;scattered bits of it.&rdquo; This is the first study of its kind to take into account data on all <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/disease" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">diseases</a> and death caused by pollution combined.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://phys.org/journals/lancet/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a>, developing countries &mdash; primarily in Asia and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/Africa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Africa</a> &mdash; are putting the most people at risk due to a lack of air and soil pollution monitoring systems. In 2015, one out of four (2.5 million) premature deaths in <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/India" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">India</a> and one out of five (1.8 million) premature deaths in China were caused by pollution-related illness. &ldquo;In the West, we got the lead out of the gasoline, so we thought lead was handled. We got rid of the burning rivers, cleaned up the worst of the toxic sites. And then all of those discussions went into the background,&rdquo; said Richard Fuller, head of the Pure Earth and one of the 47 scientists who contributed to the report. In <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/Bangladesh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bangladesh</a>, Pakistan, North Korea, South Sudan and Haiti, nearly one-fifth of premature deaths are pollution-related.</p>
<p><img src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/study-finds-pollution-more-deadly-than-all-war-and-violence-3-889x582.jpg" alt="AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, environment, pollution, Lancet medical journal, science, News, environmental destruction, air pollution, war, violence, poverty,"></p>
<p>Based on this information, it should not come as a surprise that the poorest suffer most from pollution-related illness. 92 percent of sickness related to <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/environment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">environmental</a> toxicity occurs in low- or middle-income countries. <a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-10-world-pollution-deadlier-wars-disasters.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Phys</a> reports, &ldquo;Environmental regulations in those countries tend to be weaker, and industries lean on outdated technologies and dirtier fuels.&rdquo; Fuller noted that this safety of the public is being compromised for industrial growth, which has negative repercussions. He said, &ldquo;What people don&rsquo;t realize is that pollution does damage to <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/economy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">economies</a>. People who are sick or dead cannot contribute to the economy. They need to be looked after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To determine the global impact of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/air-pollution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pollution</a>, the study&rsquo;s authors used methods outlined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for assessing field data from soil tests, in addition to air and water pollution data from the Global Burden of Disease. Though 9 million pollution-related deaths is a &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; estimate, it is still 15 times the number of people killed in war or other forms of violence, and six times the number killed in <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/green-transportation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">road accidents</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/study-finds-pollution-more-deadly-than-all-war-and-violence-2-889x591.jpg" alt="AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, environment, pollution, Lancet medical journal, science, News, environmental destruction, air pollution, war, violence, poverty,"></p>
<p>Ernesto Sanchez-Triana, the&nbsp;lead environmental specialist at the World Bank, said, &ldquo;The relationship between pollution and <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/poverty" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poverty</a> is very clear. And controlling pollution would help us address many other problems, from climate change to <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/malnutrition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">malnutrition</a>. The linkages can&rsquo;t be ignored.&rdquo;</p>

Although changes in Hurricane Irma's path spared Florida from the bulk of the damage, both Irma and Maria directly hit Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Hurricane Maria was particularly devastating for the more than 3.5 million American citizens living in these U.S. Caribbean territories.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>New research suggests that the boundary between South American tropical rainforests and savannas is influenced by the depth to which plants can root. Shallow rooting depth promotes the establishment of savannas. Previous research has shown that precipitation and fire mediate tropical forest and savanna distributions. The study shows that below ground conditions need to be considered to understand the distribution of terrestrial vegetation both historically and in the face of future climate change. The study by researchers of the Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre and Goethe University is based on computer vegetation models and was published in Journal of Biogeography.</p>]]></content>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Humanity is producing data at an unimaginable rate, to the point that storage technologies can&rsquo;t keep up. Every five years, the amount of data we&rsquo;re producing increases&nbsp;<a href="https://www.emc.com/leadership/digital-universe/index.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10-fold</a>, including photos and videos. Not all of it needs to be stored, but manufacturers of data storage aren&rsquo;t making hard drives and flash chips fast enough to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seagate.com/our-story/data-age-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hold what we do want to keep</a>. Since we&rsquo;re not going to stop taking pictures and recording movies, we need to develop new ways to save them.</p>
<p>Over millennia, nature has evolved an incredible information storage medium &ndash; DNA. It evolved to store genetic information, blueprints for building proteins, but DNA can be used for many more purposes than just that. DNA is also much denser than modern storage media: The data on hundreds of thousands of DVDs could fit inside a&nbsp;<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11875" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">matchbox-size package of DNA</a>. DNA is also much more durable &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.201411378" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lasting thousands of years</a>&nbsp;&ndash; than today&rsquo;s hard drives, which may last&nbsp;<a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/170748-how-long-do-hard-drives-actually-live-for" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">years or decades</a>. And while hard drive formats and connection standards become obsolete, DNA never will, at least so long as there&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>The idea of storing digital data in DNA is&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">several decades old</a>, but recent work from&nbsp;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1226355" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Harvard</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11875" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">European Bioinformatics Institute</a>&nbsp;showed that progress in modern DNA manipulation methods could make it both possible and practical today. Many research groups, including at the&nbsp;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.201411378" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ETH Zurich</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep14138" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aaj2038" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>&nbsp;are working on this problem. Our&nbsp;<a href="http://misl.cs.washington.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">own group</a>&nbsp;at the University of Washington and Microsoft&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2016/07/07/uw-microsoft-researchers-break-record-for-dna-data-storage/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">holds the world record</a>&nbsp;for the amount of data successfully stored in and retrieved from DNA &ndash; 200 megabytes.</p>
<p><strong>Preparing bits to become atoms</strong></p>
<p>Traditional media like hard drives, thumb drives or DVDs store digital data by changing either the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/88078-how-a-hard-drive-works" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">magnetic</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/flash-memory.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">electrical</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1820962,00.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">optical properties</a>&nbsp;of a material to store 0s and 1s.</p>
<p>To store data in DNA, the concept is the same, but the process is different. DNA molecules are long sequences of smaller molecules, called nucleotides &ndash; adenine, cytosine, thymine and guanine, usually designated as A, C, T and G. Rather than creating sequences of 0s and 1s, as in electronic media, DNA storage uses sequences of the nucleotides.</p>
<p>There are several ways to do this, but the general idea is to assign digital data patterns to DNA nucleotides. For instance, 00 could be equivalent to A, 01 to C, 10 to T and 11 to G. To store a picture, for example, we start with its encoding as a digital file, like a JPEG. That file is, in essence, a long string of 0s and 1s. Let&rsquo;s say the first eight bits of the file are 01111000; we break them into pairs &ndash; 01 11 10 00 &ndash; which correspond to C-G-T-A. That&rsquo;s the order in which we join the nucleotides to form a DNA strand.</p>
<p>Digital computer files can be quite large &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/332069/what-is-a-realistic-real-world-maximum-size-for-a-sqlite-database" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">even terabytes in size for large databases</a>. But individual DNA strands have to be much shorter &ndash; holding only about 20 bytes each. That&rsquo;s because the longer a DNA strand is, the harder it is to build chemically.</p>
<p>So we need to break the data into smaller chunks, and add to each an indicator of where in the sequence it falls. When it&rsquo;s time to read the DNA-stored information, that indicator will ensure all the chunks of data stay in their proper order.</p>
<p>Now we have a plan for how to store the data. Next we have to actually do it.</p>
<p><strong>Storing the data</strong></p>
<p>After determining what order the letters should go in, the DNA sequences are manufactured letter by letter with chemical reactions. These reactions are driven by equipment that takes in bottles of A&rsquo;s, C&rsquo;s, G&rsquo;s and T&rsquo;s and mixes them in a liquid solution with other chemicals to control the reactions that specify the order of the physical DNA strands.</p>
<p>This process brings us another benefit of DNA storage: backup copies. Rather than making one strand at a time, the chemical reactions make many identical strands at once, before going on to make many copies of the next strand in the series.</p>
<p>Once the DNA strands are created, we need to protect them against damage from&nbsp;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.201411378" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">humidity and light</a>. So we dry them out and put them in a container that keeps them cold and blocks water and light.</p>
<p>But stored data are useful only if we can retrieve them later.</p>
<p><strong>Reading the data back</strong></p>
<p>To read the data back out of storage, we use a sequencing machine exactly like those used for analysis of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">genomic DNA in cells</a>. This identifies the molecules, generating a letter sequence per molecule, which we then decode into a binary sequence of 0s and 1s in order. This process can destroy the DNA as it is read &ndash; but that&rsquo;s where those backup copies come into play: There are many copies of each sequence.</p>
<p>And if the backup copies get depleted, it is easy to make duplicate copies to refill the storage &ndash; just as nature&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">copies DNA all the time</a>.</p>
<p>At the moment, most DNA retrieval systems require reading all of the information stored in a particular container, even if we want only a small amount of it. This is like reading an entire hard drive&rsquo;s worth of information just to find one email message. We have developed techniques &ndash; based on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1700278" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">well-studied biochemistry methods</a>&nbsp;&ndash; that let us&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/114553" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">identify and read</a>&nbsp;only the&nbsp;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2872362.2872397" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">specific pieces of information</a>&nbsp;a user needs to retrieve from DNA storage.</p>
<p><strong>Remaining challenges</strong></p>
<p>At present, DNA storage is experimental. Before it becomes commonplace, it needs to be completely automated, and the processes of both building DNA and reading it must be improved. They are both prone to error and relatively slow. For example, today&rsquo;s DNA synthesis lets us write a few&nbsp;<a href="https://synbiobeta.com/time-new-dna-synthesis-sequencing-cost-curves-rob-carlson/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundred bytes per second</a>; a modern hard drive can write&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-read-and-write-speeds-2640236" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundreds of millions of bytes per second</a>. An average iPhone photo would take several hours to store in DNA, though it takes less than a second to save on the phone or transfer to a computer.</p>
<p>These are significant challenges, but we are optimistic because all the relevant technologies are improving rapidly. Further, DNA data storage doesn&rsquo;t need the perfect accuracy that biology requires, so researchers are likely to find even cheaper and faster ways to store information in nature&rsquo;s oldest data storage system.</p>

	<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s still a way to go from editing single-cell embryos to a full-term &ldquo;designer baby.&#822;...</p>]]></summary>
	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/28141742/GettyImages-136810267-e1501265872568.jpg" alt=""><h4>There&rsquo;s still a way to go from editing single-cell embryos to a full-term &ldquo;designer baby.&rdquo; But researchers at Oregon Health and Science University say they worked with single-cell embryos, inserting CRISPR chemicals at the time of fertilization.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement by researchers in Portland, Oregon that they&rsquo;ve successfully modified the genetic material&nbsp;<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608350/first-human-embryos-edited-in-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">of a human embryo</a>&nbsp;took some people by surprise.</p>
<p>With headlines referring to &ldquo;<a href="https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/world/americas/2017-07-27-us-university-edits-embryo-genes-in-experiment-hailed-as-groundbreaking/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">groundbreaking</a>&rdquo; research and &ldquo;<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4734364/First-editing-human-embryos-carried-United-States.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">designer babies</a>,&rdquo; you might wonder what the scientists actually accomplished. This was a big step forward, but hardly unexpected. As this kind of work proceeds, it continues to raise questions about ethical issues and how we should we react.</p>
<p><strong>What did researchers actually do?</strong></p>
<p>For a number of years now we have had the ability to alter genetic material in a cell, using a technique called CRISPR.</p>
<p>The DNA that makes up our genome comprises long sequences of base pairs, each base indicated by one of four letters. These letters form a genetic alphabet, and the &ldquo;words&rdquo; or &ldquo;sentences&rdquo; created from a particular order of letters are the genes that determine our characteristics.</p>
<p>Sometimes words can be &ldquo;misspelled&rdquo; or sentences slightly garbled, resulting in a disease or disorder. Genetic engineering is designed to correct those mistakes. CRISPR is a tool that enables scientists to target a specific area of a gene, working like the search-and-replace function in Microsoft Word, to remove a section and insert the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; sequence.</p>
<p>In the last decade, CRISPR has been the primary tool for those seeking to modify genes &ndash; human and otherwise. Among other things, it has been used in experiments to make&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3439" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mosquitoes resistant to malaria</a>, genetically&nbsp;<a href="http://www.genengnews.com/gen-exclusives/crispr-applications-in-plants/77900846" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">modify plants to be resistant to disease</a>, explore the possibility of&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature.2015.18448" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">engineered pets</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/crispr-used-cows-help-fight-tuberculosis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">livestock</a>, and potentially treat some human diseases (including&nbsp;<a href="http://sites.tufts.edu/crispr/applications/hiv-treatment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HIV</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.15252/emmm.201606325" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hemophilia</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtn.2016.12.012" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">leukemia</a>).</p>
<p>Up until recently, the focus in humans has been on changing the cells of a single individual, and not changing eggs, sperm and early embryos &ndash; what are called the &ldquo;germline&rdquo; cells that pass traits along to offspring. The theory is that focusing on non-germline cells would limit any unexpected long-term impact of genetic changes on descendants. At the same time, this limitation means that we would have to use the technique in every generation, which affects its potential therapeutic benefit.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, an international committee convened by the National Academy of Sciences&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.17226/24623" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued a report</a>&nbsp;that, while highlighting the concerns with human germline genetic engineering, laid out a series of&nbsp;<a href="http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=24623" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">safeguards and recommended oversight</a>. The report was widely regarded as opening the door to embryo-editing research.</p>
<p>That is exactly what happened in Oregon. Although this is the first study reported in the United States, similar research has been&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s13238-015-0153-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conducted in China</a>. This new study, however, apparently avoided previous errors we&rsquo;ve seen with CRISPR &ndash; such as changes in other, untargeted parts of the genome, or the desired change not occurring in all cells. Both of these problems had made scientists wary of using CRISPR to make changes in embryos that might eventually be used in a human pregnancy. Evidence of more successful (and thus safer) CRISPR use may lead to additional studies involving human embryos.</p>
<p><strong>What didn&rsquo;t happen in Oregon?</strong></p>
<p>First, this study did not entail the creation of &ldquo;designer babies,&rdquo; despite some news headlines. The research involved only early stage embryos, outside the womb, none of which was allowed to develop beyond a few days.</p>
<p>In fact, there are a number of existing limits &ndash; both policy-based and scientific &ndash; that will create barriers to implanting an edited embryo to achieve the birth of a child. There is a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/statement-nih-funding-research-using-gene-editing-technologies-human-embryos" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">federal ban on funding</a>&nbsp;gene editing research in embryos; in some states, there are also&nbsp;<a href="https://nyscf.org/scmapus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">total bans on embryo research</a>, regardless of how funded. In addition, the implantation of an edited human embryos would be regulated under the&nbsp;<a href="https://humansubjects.nih.gov/pregnant-women-human-fetuses-neonates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">federal human research regulations</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/cellulargenetherapyproducts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act</a>and potentially the federal rules regarding&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/CLIA/Regulatory/default.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">clinical laboratory testing</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond the regulatory barriers, we are a long way from having the scientific knowledge necessary to design our children. While the Oregon experiment focused on a single gene correction to inherited diseases, there are few human traits that are controlled by one gene. Anything that involves multiple genes or a gene/environment interaction will be less amenable to this type of engineering. Most characteristics we might be interested in designing &ndash; such as intelligence, personality, athletic or artistic or musical ability &ndash; are much more complex.</p>
<p>Second, while this is a significant step forward in the science regarding the use of the CRISPR technique, it is only one step. There is a long way to go between this and a cure for various disease and disorders. This is not to say that there aren&rsquo;t concerns. But we have some time to consider the issues before the use of the technique becomes a mainstream medical practice.</p>
<p><strong>So what should we be concerned about?</strong></p>
<p>Taking into account the cautions above, we do need to decide when and how we should use this technique.</p>
<p>Should there be limits on the types of things you can edit in an embryo? If so, what should they entail? These questions also involve deciding who gets to set the limits and control access to the technology.</p>
<p>We may also be concerned about who gets to control the subsequent research using this technology. Should there be state or federal oversight? Keep in mind that we cannot control what happens in other countries. Even in this country it can be difficult to craft guidelines that restrict only the research someone finds objectionable, while allowing other important research to continue. Additionally, the use of assisted reproductive technologies (IVF, for example) is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rockinst.org/pdf/health_care/2009-07-States_Regulation_ART.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">largely unregulated in the U.S.</a>, and the decision to put in place restrictions will certainly raise objections from both potential parents and IVF providers.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are important questions about cost and access. Right now most assisted reproductive technologies are available only to higher-income individuals. A handful of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/insurance-coverage-for-infertility-laws.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">states mandate infertility treatment coverage</a>, but it is very limited. How should we regulate access to embryo editing for serious diseases? We are in the midst of a&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/us/topics/us-health-care-reform-40185" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">widespread debate</a>about health care, access and cost. If it becomes established and safe, should this technique be part of a basic package of health care services when used to help create a child who does not suffer from a specific genetic problem? What about editing for nonhealth issues or less serious problems &ndash; are there fairness concerns if only people with sufficient wealth can access?</p>
<p>So far the promise of genetic engineering for disease eradication has not lived up to its hype. Nor have many other milestones, like the 1996&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/20-years-after-dolly-everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-the-cloned-sheep-and-what-came-next-72655" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cloning of Dolly the sheep</a>, resulted in the feared apocalypse. The announcement of the Oregon study is only the next step in a long line of research. Nonetheless, it is sure to bring many of the issues about embryos, stem cell research, genetic engineering and reproductive technologies back into the spotlight. Now is the time to figure out how we want to see this gene-editing path unfold.</p>

<h4>There&rsquo;s a lot happening in the world of blockchain, the sometimes hard-to-grasp disruptive technology.&nbsp;Jess McCuan, content creator-in-chief with Quid, whose software can read millions of news articles for collective intelligence, uses data-focused visuals to help others easily&nbsp;digest blockchain&rsquo;s biggest news in the last year.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you work in finance or own any <a href="http://money.cnn.com/infographic/technology/what-is-bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bitcoin</a>, you likely already know about blockchain technology.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But for those in neither category, here&rsquo;s a quick overview of a year&rsquo;s worth of news about blockchains, databases that essentially make records <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21677228-technology-behind-bitcoin-lets-people-who-do-not-know-or-trust-each-other-build-dependable" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more verifiable and permanent</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>For this analysis, we used <a href="https://quid.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Quid</a>, software that searches and analyses massive amounts of data and then offers insight by organizing that content visually.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a big year for news about blockchain, heralded as a technology that will disrupt several industries <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/article/seven-industries-that-blockchain-will-disrupt-in-2017-cm734366" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">beyond banking</a> in 2017.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Last spring, the biggest headline in the blockchain world was that an Australian entrepreneur, Craig Wright, finally <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/05/02/bitcoin-satoshi-wright/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">came out of the shadows</a> and declared he was the creator of the cryptocurrency bitcoin (though plenty were skeptical). Then a massive <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/06/50-million-hack-just-showed-dao-human/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">security breach at the decentralized autonomous organization </a>was such a blow to blockchain that journalists wrote about the event all year. Last fall Ripple, which develops a payment protocol and exchange network, announced it had <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/09/15/ripple-raises-55m-adds-major-bank-partners-as-blockchain-gains-ground/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raised $50 million</a> and partnered with major banks. In the timeline below, we identified several other events that generated significant news volume.</p>
<div><a href="http://www.gereports.com/?attachment_id=29677" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16125010/3np9AAj7qyW9XAW70Xn78W2Ha892gedrVGSr1r_juW0-1024x768.jpg" alt="blockchain" width="1024" height="768" srcset="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16125010/3np9AAj7qyW9XAW70Xn78W2Ha892gedrVGSr1r_juW0.jpg 1024w, http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16125010/3np9AAj7qyW9XAW70Xn78W2Ha892gedrVGSr1r_juW0-300x225.jpg 300w, http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16125010/3np9AAj7qyW9XAW70Xn78W2Ha892gedrVGSr1r_juW0-768x576.jpg 768w, http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16125010/3np9AAj7qyW9XAW70Xn78W2Ha892gedrVGSr1r_juW0-665x499.jpg 665w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><p>A Quid timeline maps 3,409 stories about blockchain, colored by cluster, from global news sources between 20 April 2016-20 April 2017. In the graph above, Quid sampled the data to show which stories generated the most volume in relation to each other.</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Sorting all that data into a network, major themes emerge. The theme that generated the most stories was contracts and regulation. These stories, which account for 10 percent of the network, include wide-ranging debates about blockchain, suggesting it <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/revolutionary-smart-contracts-automate-trust" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fosters trust</a> in certain contract-heavy areas of finance or, on the other hand, exposes financial markets to <a href="http://www.hk-lawyer.org/content/blockchain-exposes-securities-markets-aml-and-terrorist-financing-risk-says-esma" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">money laundering and terrorist financing</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Other important themes: blockchain&rsquo;s effect on mobile payments, trade finance, and augmented and virtual reality. The more surprising themes and developments: some countries see blockchain technology as a way to cut down on voting fraud, and others, like Australia, are starting to incorporate blockchain into peer-to-peer solar power exchanges.</p>
<div><a href="http://www.gereports.com/?attachment_id=29679" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16125138/1ydcYcAU_iyh7kO-HBacU3AvG7H6a_a25-rGbXklA1s-1024x768.jpg" alt="blockchain" width="1024" height="768" srcset="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16125138/1ydcYcAU_iyh7kO-HBacU3AvG7H6a_a25-rGbXklA1s.jpg 1024w, http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16125138/1ydcYcAU_iyh7kO-HBacU3AvG7H6a_a25-rGbXklA1s-300x225.jpg 300w, http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16125138/1ydcYcAU_iyh7kO-HBacU3AvG7H6a_a25-rGbXklA1s-768x576.jpg 768w, http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16125138/1ydcYcAU_iyh7kO-HBacU3AvG7H6a_a25-rGbXklA1s-665x499.jpg 665w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><p>A Quid network represents data from 3,409 stories about blockchain, colored by cluster, from global news sources between 20 April 2016 and 20 April 2017.</p></div>
</div>
<p>Next, the major players in blockchain. At the top of the list: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blythe_Masters" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Blythe Masters</a>, an economist and former JPMorgan Chase executive who&rsquo;s now running the software company Digital Asset Holdings. Then<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/about/leadership" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Bryan Behlendorf</a>, a former programmer who now runs the open-source project Hyperledger. Quid identified Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym of the bitcoin founder, and Craig Wright as two separate individuals, though Wright claims that they are in fact the same person (interestingly, the two entities appear in different areas of the network).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gereports.com/?attachment_id=29681" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16125313/iUgHsqpBYQxMpvZ3CWOW_D3J4aYQD3r6d5k0zTggwaA-1024x768.jpg" alt="blockchain" width="1024" height="768" srcset="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16125313/iUgHsqpBYQxMpvZ3CWOW_D3J4aYQD3r6d5k0zTggwaA.jpg 1024w, http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16125313/iUgHsqpBYQxMpvZ3CWOW_D3J4aYQD3r6d5k0zTggwaA-300x225.jpg 300w, http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16125313/iUgHsqpBYQxMpvZ3CWOW_D3J4aYQD3r6d5k0zTggwaA-768x576.jpg 768w, http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16125313/iUgHsqpBYQxMpvZ3CWOW_D3J4aYQD3r6d5k0zTggwaA-665x499.jpg 665w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>In a network of news stories that shows largely positive sentiment, skepticism about Wright and his claims is one of the few areas of negative sentiment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gereports.com/?attachment_id=29683" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16125459/zm38Hm6A_WxH9bvhKvFA_p3Gm8_vyJyvdZGnscfAzYA-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16125459/zm38Hm6A_WxH9bvhKvFA_p3Gm8_vyJyvdZGnscfAzYA.jpg 1024w, http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16125459/zm38Hm6A_WxH9bvhKvFA_p3Gm8_vyJyvdZGnscfAzYA-300x225.jpg 300w, http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16125459/zm38Hm6A_WxH9bvhKvFA_p3Gm8_vyJyvdZGnscfAzYA-768x576.jpg 768w, http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16125459/zm38Hm6A_WxH9bvhKvFA_p3Gm8_vyJyvdZGnscfAzYA-665x499.jpg 665w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p>Finally, we ran a search that combined both the words &ldquo;blockchain&rdquo; and &ldquo;future&rdquo; to see if the future of blockchain looks any different than the present.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In a network view, there were some notable differences, namely, the emergence of blockchain in sectors beyond finance. The future of blockchain appears to veer more heavily into music and the arts, where the technology helps musicians and others protect the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/08/how-blockchain-can-change-the-music-industry/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">copyrights to their work</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>And in the future, it seems blockchain may also play a bigger role in healthcare and medical records, insurance and green energy.</p>

	<title type="html">The Future Of Home Robotics: Capable, Personable And Cute? </title>
	<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If working in robotics for the last 15&nbsp;years has taught Mayfield Robotics CTO Kaijen Hsiao anything,...</p>]]></summary>
	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/26142316/Kuri_Entertains1-e1493231044120.jpg" alt="home robotics"><h4><span>If working in robotics for the last 15&nbsp;years has taught Mayfield Robotics CTO Kaijen Hsiao anything, it&rsquo;s that as the market for home robots evolves, so will consumer expectations. &nbsp;Those expectations are centered not only on technological capabilities, but also on a home robot&rsquo;s personality and the overall experience of interactions.</span> <span>Currently, home robotics is perceived in the context of either some sort of digitized assistant or a simple, utilitarian tool for cleaning. But Kuri, an &ldquo;insanely cute and useful&rdquo; personal robot, leaves the user feeling like home robots are commonplace, friendly and welcoming.</span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The concept of the </span><i><span>home</span></i><span> robot is still new to most people. &nbsp;When asked to imagine a home robot, most people either think of robot vacuum cleaners or fictional robots like Rosie, the robot maid from &ldquo;The Jetsons.&rdquo; &nbsp;While digital assistive technologies such as Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant are no longer a new concept, robotic assistance in the home beyond cleaning still is. &nbsp;Recently, however, there has been an eruption of potential new home robots, specifically in the home assistant / companion space. &nbsp;This blooming of robotic technology in the home is the result of recent technological breakthroughs, and also sets the stage for what the next five years of home robots will look like, including more focus on a robot&rsquo;s personality. </span></p>
<p><strong>How We Got Here</strong></p>
<p><span>The last five years have seen huge improvements in three key areas of robotics. &nbsp;The first is lowered cost and availability of key components. With parts becoming cheaper, useful home assistant robots that can navigate around your home and be aware of their surroundings can finally be made at a price point that is attractive to a wider consumer market. &nbsp;The second is speech recognition technology, which has finally reached a point where users can reliably and consistently issue commands to home robots directly. Finally, advances in vision, and in particular deep-learning-based vision, have recently enabled robots to be aware of people and pets around them, thus setting the stage for compelling interactions between humans and robots that grant robots the appearance of personality.</span></p>
<p><strong>The Future of Home Robotics: Personality and Character</strong></p>
<p><span>At this point in time, robot capabilities such as mapping and navigation are still more difficult to implement than voice recognition capabilities. &nbsp;But we are starting to see such capabilities becoming commoditized and more affordable. In the next five years, the increased availability of vision-based navigation will lower the barriers to entry in the home robot space. &nbsp;At that point, the market is likely to become much more crowded, and the major factor that determines the success or failure of individual robots will be personality.</span></p>
<div><a href="http://www.gereports.com/?attachment_id=29106" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/26142444/Kuri_Speaks_Robot-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/26142444/Kuri_Speaks_Robot-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/26142444/Kuri_Speaks_Robot-300x169.jpg 300w, http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/26142444/Kuri_Speaks_Robot-768x432.jpg 768w, http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/26142444/Kuri_Speaks_Robot-665x374.jpg 665w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><p>Courtesy: Mayfield Robotics</p></div>
<p><span>We at Mayfield like to say that we make joyful, useful and inspiring robots&mdash;and all three of those features are equally important.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.heykuri.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Kuri</span></a><span> needs to be useful to earn a place in your home, but we also hope that she will inspire others to both create more robots like her and to be interested in STEM fields even from an early age. But perhaps most importantly, for her acceptance in your home and in daily life, she needs to provide joy. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>A great deal of care went into creating Kuri&rsquo;s personality, something that few other robots have explored in depth. &nbsp;</span><a href="https://anki.com/en-us/cozmo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Anki&rsquo;s Cozmo</span></a><span> is one exception; their fun little toy robot showed personality to be critical in eliciting a positive reaction from consumers. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re seeing that the capabilities of a robot are important, but even more important are the emotional interactions that take place between robots and humans. &nbsp;As the technology improves, cost lowers, and consumer expectation increases, home robots will ultimately become a form of art and entertainment. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Opportunities in Robotics</strong></p>
<p><span>The creation of relevant, useful, and personality-filled home robots will demand talented professionals, and not just roboticists and engineers. Think of it like video games: the amount of time, energy and work that goes into creating one is staggering, and yet the most amazing visual effects ever invented can&rsquo;t save a game if the story isn&rsquo;t good or the characters look creepy as they move. Creative types, animators and industrial designers will be needed not just to create more complex and functional robots, but to create and deliver a new form of entertainment. The home robot will be not just a capable assistant, but something with personality&mdash;life-like, a companion in the home that you actually like having around.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What will cities look like by the year 2050? Will they be like those in South Korea <a href="http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/south_korea802/video/video_index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">centered on a digitally connected</a> retrofit of existing society; will they parallel the shiny new cities of Dubai or Singapore; or could they possibly move underground or <a href="https://futurism.com/videos/this-26-billion-underwater-city-could-be-ready-in-15-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">under the oceans</a>?</p>
<p>Today, innovative cities such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/06/story-of-cities-37-mayor-jaime-lerner-curitiba-brazil-green-capital-global-icon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Curitiba, Brazil</a>, are rethinking entire mass-transportation strategies while debating visions of <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/fastlane/dot-seeks-proposals-automated-vehicle-technology-%E2%80%9Cproving-grounds%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">autonomous cars</a> and <a href="http://www.techzone360.com/topics/techzone/articles/2017/01/16/428813-airbus-enters-human-carrying-drone-race-but-where.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drones</a>. The most basic infrastructure needs have always been about how people want to live and move around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also about how <em>things </em>move around. FedEx sees e-commerce increasing by 26 percent from 2016 to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-02-01/fedex-pushes-for-infrastructure-fix-as-trump-weighs-investment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2.4 trillion worldwide by 2018</a>, which adds pressure to upgrade roads, highways, and port/airport infrastructure for vehicle use&mdash;autonomous or otherwise.</p>
<p>Add to this mix myriad technology disruptions such as sensors, Big Data, and the Internet of Things (IoT), which can help adjacent cities work together like cogs in a bigger machine.</p>
<p>But why is that important? Planners have been considering <a href="https://redshift.autodesk.com/the-future-of-cities/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">urbanization</a> pressures, often in areas with little room to increase building or infrastructure capacity. One alternative is analyzing collected data to determine how to densify corridors of population between neighboring cities, with mass transit creating megaregions that could easily become home to millions more.</p>
<p>The challenge for cities around the world is, how do they grow? How do they perform and transform simultaneously?</p>
<p><strong>Data and the Megacities of the Future</strong></p>
<p>Neighboring cities are coalescing in their shared infrastructure and mutual impact of their economies. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/maps-of-american-infrastrucure/?tid=ss_tw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Power lines, roads, transit, water systems, and safety</a> don&rsquo;t stop at city limits, and municipalities are facing transformation at unprecedented rates. As a result, there&rsquo;s a lot of debate about who decides the way forward and what that looks like.</p>
<p>When it comes to designing infrastructure, one thing is for sure: Big Data collected through the IoT will play a key role in growing the megacities of 2050. &ldquo;Big Data is all the information around us that is being collected in various streams,&rdquo; says Steph Stoppenhagen, smart cities business development director for Black &amp; Veatch. &ldquo;If you use a metrocard to get on a subway, then the system knows when you entered, where you went, and the route you took. How is this helpful? By recognizing if the subway service worked. Was it successful? If so, you will do it again and again. That is one example of using data to watch people&rsquo;s movements&mdash;creating smarter mobility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not all data easily translates into useful or actionable information, though. To address the changing urban landscape, information itself should be seen as a form of infrastructure&mdash;one that can be used for better planning to <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/11/us-commutes-reveal-new-economic-megaregions-map/#/03megaregions.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">connect</a> cities within a bigger system.</p>
<p>The starting point is people, not technology. Planning, design, and investment decisions&mdash;along with supportive policy making&mdash;can be informed and expedited via infrastructure visualization, simulation, and analysis. The rise of Big Data and advanced modeling technology make it possible to plan and prioritize infrastructure investment with greater foresight, better communicate potential outcomes, and <a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/05/How-Big-Cities-Mine-Big-Data-Solve-Big-Problems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">yield measurably better results</a>.</p>
<p>Creating <a href="https://redshift.autodesk.com/smart-cities/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">smart cities</a> means more than using the IoT to optimize services or communicate information to residents: It should be a construct used to frame local government decision making around <a href="http://zofnass.gsd.harvard.edu/planning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">city transformation</a>. While 2050 seems far off, for existing cities that must perform, transform, and compete with brand-new cities, it&rsquo;s pretty close at hand. Cities need to evolve to develop sustainably; improve resilience; meet citizens&rsquo; rising expectations; and attract investment, new businesses, and talent. The good news is that data and technology will make work and life better by creating a well-connected community.</p>
<p>But smart investment and policy decisions are crucial to planning, and moving to long-term investment (versus grant funding) is key. To achieve that, cities must connect:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Projects: </strong>Developments that build toward the <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/5062-7-planned-cities-designed-to-change-our-urban-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unified city vision</a>and meet broader economic objectives such as accessibility, jobs, affordable housing, and healthy environments.</li>
<li><strong>Teams:</strong> Collaborative efforts functioning across all levels of government to unlock public and private infrastructure investment, leveraging Big Data to track the performance of infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Insights:</strong> New technologies that revolutionize how cities are planned, function, and grow the economy by connecting everyone at the beginning of project planning.</li>
<li><strong>Outcomes:</strong> Projects that meet planning/business-case measures and use cost-benefit analyses to meet economic objectives.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Future of Planning Is 3D</strong></p>
<p>Building Information Modeling (BIM) gives meaning to the vast information available to architects and engineers, urban citizens, and decision makers. Advanced 3D modeling allows people to analyze complex information, including risks and problems at a system-versus-asset level. What that means is thinking about what the whole infrastructure system is trying to accomplish versus goals of its individual components. That information helps architects and engineers enhance designs so individuals, firms, and cities can meet their &ldquo;smart&rdquo; connected goals, bringing neighboring cities together.</p>
<p>Consistent use of <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/solutions/bim/hub/building-a-bim-city-featuring-kalyani-group" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D in-context models</a> coupled with simulation software can create a hypothetical but realistic scenario of the physical infrastructure&rsquo;s performance. It establishes a concrete vision in 3D, setting the context for discussing goals and performance measures that everyone can understand.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.autodesk.com/solutions/bim/civil-infrastructure/urban#related-video-stunning-cyber-city-visualization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technology</a> lets people see with both eyes open&mdash;gaining perspective <em>and </em>depth&mdash;rather than with one eye closed, which gives&nbsp;perspective but no depth. The depth comes from information streaming through technology: Information-rich models can help stretch infrastructure investment dollars throughout the design and construction phases.</p>
<p>Going forward, using 2D designs in an ever-changing 3D world won&rsquo;t work. Using 3D BIM processes will be a critical skill set to build the right infrastructure for a megacities-of-the-future vision.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Smart Foundations Together</strong></p>
<p>Cities are often overwhelmed by&nbsp;Big Data and lack the ability to make the information actionable. A benefit of BIM is that it can manage connections among all the data useful for complex city design projects&mdash;from the micro to macro level.</p>
<p>Through an <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/solutions/bim/hub/building-a-bim-city-featuring-kalyani-group" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">immersive collaboration</a>, the general public will better understand the future of infrastructure design. This way of stepping into, around, and through infrastructure virtually is becoming the norm. It aids in faster design-concept creation, vetting, and approval, and it reduces stakeholder pushback.</p>
<p>In this era of connected BIM&mdash;where information forms the infrastructure for planning, designing, and maintaining manmade and natural systems&mdash;the objective is to create integrated and resilient infrastructure. Then, cities will be able to withstand and <a href="http://bimontherocks.com/reconstructing-a-town-with-bim/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recover more quickly from natural and human-caused disasters</a>&mdash;and grow to support their future.</p>
<p>By collecting and analyzing more information, civil engineers will better predict what&rsquo;s needed to manage bridges, roads, and other infrastructure assets, prolonging their lifecycles. As populations increase and demand for infrastructure rises, future-proofing assets must take into account true lifecycle costs.</p>
<p>Smart infrastructure connections at a personal, community, metropolitan, or even national level&mdash;underpinned by technology&mdash;provide the capability for monitoring and measuring. Then the analysis of data feedback can yield positive steps to address issues (whether through human or machine actions).</p>
<p>This changes the vision of cities and provides the foundation for more holistic planning. In connected <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/10-most-populous-cities-2050-2016-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2050 cities</a>, all kinds of infrastructure&mdash;energy, water, transportation, buildings, and governance&mdash;will &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to each other to prioritize needs, optimize performance, minimize energy use, and make life more enjoyable and productive for the people who live in and travel between cities.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14142412/Screen-Shot-2017-04-14-at-2.23.38-PM-e1492194310140.jpg" alt=""><h4>Well, what are we waiting for?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NASA scientists have found more evidence that Saturn&rsquo;s icy moon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Enceladus</a>&nbsp;could support life: the presence of hydrogen molecules in huge geysers of water shooting up from the surface.</p>
<p>The discovery of this chemical energy source means Enceladus is currently the very best place to look for life outside of Earth, with conditions that could be just right for alien microbes to survive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the closest we&rsquo;ve come, so far, to identifying a place with some of the ingredients needed for a habitable environment,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-missions-provide-new-insights-into-ocean-worlds-in-our-solar-system" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said Thomas Zurbuchen</a>, associate administrator for NASA&rsquo;s Science Mission Directorate.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got the Cassini spacecraft to thank for the new findings, as the probe has been busy taking measurements around Saturn and Enceladus since 2004.</p>
<p>An analysis of the samples Cassini <a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/nasa-s-cassini-spacecraft-just-made-a-deep-dive-in-enceladus-s-icy-plumes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">took two years ago</a>, as it flew through the geysers of Enceladus, have now revealed these tell-tale hydrogen molecules.</p>
<p>The hydrogen strongly suggests that hydrothermal activity is going on in <a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/a-vast-global-ocean-lies-under-the-surface-of-saturn-s-moon-enceladus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the ocean below the surface</a> of Enceladus, and because some of the most basic lifeforms on Earth thrive in ocean vents like the ones Cassini has been flying over, the same type of life could exist on Saturn&rsquo;s moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t tell us whether life is there or not,&rdquo; astronomer Jonathan Lunine, from the Cornell Centre for Astrophysics and Planetary Science, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/saturns-moon-enceladus-has-the-basic-ingredients-for-li-1794296870" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told Gizmodo</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just makes the case for the ocean being able to support life that much stronger.&rdquo;</p>
<div><a href="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14143325/enceladus-news-2.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14143325/enceladus-news-2.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="394" srcset="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14143325/enceladus-news-2.jpg 700w, http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14143325/enceladus-news-2-300x169.jpg 300w, http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14143325/enceladus-news-2-665x374.jpg 665w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></a><p>NASA/JPL-Caltech</p></div>
<p>We&rsquo;ve suspected for a while that water is being heated below the surface of Enceladus, but the presence of hydrogen just about confirms it: the reaction of certain minerals with hot rocks is the most likely explanation for the large amounts of hydrogen found by Cassini.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the hydrogen discovery also makes it more likely that methane is being produced from carbon dioxide on the moon, a process known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanogenesis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">methanogenesis</a>.</p>
<p>The hydrogen and the methanogenesis could well provide a food source for microbes, experts think, in the same way it does on Earth.</p>
<p>In other words, Earth&rsquo;s microbes could probably live on Enceladus.</p>
<p>But, the hydrogen is so abundant that it might also mean there are no microbes around to eat it up, NASA said in its press conference today, or that microbes are there but only in a very small number.</p>
<p>For the time being we just don&rsquo;t know &ndash; but the ingredients for life are there, based on the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-missions-provide-new-insights-into-ocean-worlds-in-our-solar-system" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research published today</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The discovery of native molecular hydrogen [H2] completes the set of what I would call the &lsquo;basic&rsquo; requirements for life as we know it: liquid water, organic molecules, minerals, and an accessible source of &lsquo;free&rsquo; energy,&rdquo; <a href="http://gizmodo.com/saturns-moon-enceladus-has-the-basic-ingredients-for-li-1794296870?rev=1492102341781" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lunine explained to Gizmodo</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The H2 discovery completes the case for going back to Enceladus to look for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time, scientists working with the Hubble telescope say they&rsquo;ve found more evidence that another of Jupiter&rsquo;s moons, Europa, is spurting out watery jets of its own, giving us yet another potential spot where life might develop.</p>
<p>Researchers have suggested <a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/hubble-may-have-caught-jets-of-water-squirting-out-of-a-potentially-habitable-moon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Europa has geysers of its own</a> before, but this latest evidence is more compelling. For the time being though, Enceladus remains the most promising place to look for life.</p>
<p>Sadly, we soon have to <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-how-and-when-nasa-will-finally-destroy-cassini" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">say goodbye to Cassini</a> after all the fantastic work it&rsquo;s been doing in studying Saturn and its moons.</p>
<p>The spacecraft will crash into Saturn in September, after a job well done.</p>
<p>The findings have now been published in <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/132" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Science</em></a>.</p>

<p>Now Vinciquerra and his team are using their insights to improve the way 3D printers work.</p>
<p>Even though companies like GE already print parts for jet engines, additive manufacturing is still a young field. It can take days to weeks to print large parts such as a compressor blade. If something goes wrong near the end of the process, precious machine time and money could go to waste.</p>
<p>The GE researchers are building a system that could speed up the process and eventually achieve &ldquo;100 percent yield,&rdquo; an engineer&rsquo;s Nirvana where machines only produce good parts, beginning with the very first build. &ldquo;We do a tremendous amount of work on additive powders to understand what characteristics lead to a good build,&rdquo; says materials scientist Kate Gurnon, a member of the team. &ldquo;We want to apply this automatically to the machines and, in real time, observe the dynamic behavior of the powder delivery to the build plate. In this way, we will have a better chance of getting to the 100 percent yield, faster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3D printing and other additive manufacturing methods print parts directly from a computer file. They can shape a component by fusing together thin layers of metal powder with a laser, for example. But even these highly-advanced machines are prone to variability. There are a number of culprits &ldquo;that can make the difference between a good build and a build that has sub-optimal properties,&rdquo; Vinciquerra says. They include variation in the size of the powder particles, as well as &ldquo;the complex dynamic of adding new powder layers,&rdquo; which can be as thin as a human hair. &ldquo;We know that things happen during this re-coating process that you cannot control mechanically,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We also know that the more we reuse powder, the more opportunities exist for that powder to change and behave differently over time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>AI and machine learning can help. &ldquo;Using artificial intelligence and machine learning, we will turn 3D printers into essentially their own inspectors,&rdquo; Vinciquerra says. &ldquo;By eliminating the need to inspect parts after they&rsquo;re completely built, we can shave days, even weeks off the entire manufacturing process and lead to a breakthrough in productivity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The team starts by printing simple geometric shapes like flat bars and cylinders. They use high-resolution cameras to film every layer and record streaks, pits, divots and other patterns in the powder practically invisible to humans. Next, they run the samples through a powerful CT scanner and hunt for flaws.</p>
<p>All of the data is stored in computer memory and a proprietary machine-learning algorithm correlates defects revealed by the scanners with powder patterns recorded on the particular layer. &ldquo;The more often you do it, the smarter the system gets,&rdquo; Vinciquerra says. &ldquo;The computer vision alone will eventually have enough training to tell us whether we are going to have a problem.&rdquo;</p>
<div><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dsg.files.app.content.prod/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/10101105/Inside-laser-machine-2.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dsg.files.app.content.prod/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/10101105/Inside-laser-machine-2-1024x512.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="320" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dsg.files.app.content.prod/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/10101105/Inside-laser-machine-2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/dsg.files.app.content.prod/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/10101105/Inside-laser-machine-2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/dsg.files.app.content.prod/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/10101105/Inside-laser-machine-2-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a><p><em>&ldquo;Using artificial intelligence and machine learning, we will turn 3D printers into essentially their own inspectors,&rdquo; says GE&rsquo;s Joe Vinciquerra. Image credit: Concept Laser</em></p></div>
<p>But Vinciquerra and Gurnon are going deeper. They are working with other members of the team to loop the defect-spotting ability into machine controls to make the 3D printer smarter. When the computer vision spots a familiar streak that it knows will lead to cavities, for example, the printer can automatically add more power or speed to the laser beam to adjust, or change the thickness of the next layer. &ldquo;The idea is that the machine has a compensation strategy based on what the computer vision sees,&rdquo; Vinciquerra says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the long-term goal here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One way to get there is to build a &ldquo;digital twin,&rdquo; a virtual representation of the production process that can compare ideal conditions with reality in real time and suggest changes to reach a flawless result. Vinciquerra says that the digital twin is &ldquo;sort of a recipe card&rdquo; that &ldquo;represents the gold standard of how the material should be processed&rdquo; in the 3D printer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s telling me that if I use these parameters to build a part from a certain material, I can expect this kind of behavior in the final product,&rdquo; Vinciquerra says.</p>
<p>The next generation of the twin will be able to gather computer vision data but also collect information from other sensors monitoring the printing process, such as the shape of the tiny pool of metal rendered molten by the laser.</p>
<p>Vinciquerra notes that some of GE&rsquo;s most advanced 3D-printed parts for GE Aviation can take more than a week to complete and require several more hours after that for processing and validation. &ldquo;If we could recognize a defect very early in a part build, we would have an opportunity to stop and start over,&rdquo; Vinciquerra added. &ldquo;On the other hand, if a part is more than halfway through a build, we could evaluate whether the defect could be fixed by adjusting the rest of the layers being printed. We have never had this degree of flexibility in manufacturing.&rdquo;</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Genome editing technologies have revolutionized biomedical science, providing a fast and easy way to modify genes. However, the technique allowing scientists to carryout the most precise edits, doesn't work in cells that are no longer dividing - which includes most neurons in the brain. This technology had limited use in brain research, until now. Research Fellow Jun Nishiyama, M.D., Ph.D., Research Scientist, Takayasu Mikuni, M.D., Ph.D., and Scientific Director, Ryohei Yasuda, Ph.D. at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) have developed a new tool that, for the first time, allows precise genome editing in mature neurons, opening up vast new possibilities in neuroscience research.</p>]]></content>

	<title type="html">From Light To Bright: San Diego Is Building The World’s Largest Municipal Internet Of Things</title>
	<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>San Diego&rsquo;s newest streetlights might not look all that special &mdash; and that&rsquo;s exactly the point. Desi...</p>]]></summary>
	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/22164454/city-scape.jpg" alt=""><p>San Diego&rsquo;s newest streetlights might not look all that special &mdash; and that&rsquo;s exactly the point. Designed to blend in with the rest of the city&rsquo;s outdoor lighting, they&rsquo;re easy to overlook. Under the surface, though, the LED fixtures are actually data-gathering machines.&nbsp;They will allow San Diego to build the largest municipal internet-of-things network in the world.</p>
<p>San Diego&rsquo;s digital lighting revolution started as a modest solution to a common problem. &ldquo;We were broke,&rdquo; says David Graham, San Diego&rsquo;s deputy chief operating officer. &ldquo;In the early 2000s, we went through about a decade of fiscal crisis, and we were trying to find ways to be more efficient, save money and reduce energy usage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One idea to save money was to replace the yellow glow of the city&rsquo;s old sodium vapor streetlamps with efficient new LED lights. In addition to providing cleaner, broader-spectrum light, the new fixtures used 60 percent less energy and slashed maintenance needs because of their longer life spans. The city <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/environment/sdut-san-diego-swtiches-green-street-lights-2011sep19-htmlstory.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">replaced more than 35,000 lights</a>, yielding an estimated $2.2 million in savings per year.</p>
<p>But the new fixtures also brought to light new problems. &ldquo;We know when a traditional light bulb isn&rsquo;t working, because it burns out,&rdquo; says Austin Ashe, general manager of Current, powered by GE&rsquo;s Intelligent Cities program. &ldquo;But an LED doesn&rsquo;t burn out. It just degrades over time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As GE replaced the lights, San Diego asked for a better way to monitor the LEDs. The answer, and the first step toward connecting the city&rsquo;s lighting infrastructure, was LightGrid. This adaptive control program connected streetlights through a wireless network, enabling the city to monitor and manage lights remotely. &ldquo;Now we know exactly how much energy a streetlight is using,&rdquo; Graham says. &ldquo;We know if it&rsquo;s out. We can brighten or dim it, depending on environmental factors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But LightGrid was just the first step. San Diego soon discovered it could reap additional benefits through expanded connectivity. San Diego agreed to be the first city to <a href="http://www.gereports.com/smart-streets-are-made-of-these-san-diego-deploys-americas-first-intelligent-lighting-system/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pilot GE&rsquo;s intelligent cities platform</a> &mdash; enabled by adding nodes holding multiple sensors to streetlights. The nodes connected to Predix, GE&rsquo;s operating system for the Industrial Internet, to process the metadata collected by the sensors.</p>
<div><a href="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/22164746/City-IQ-multi-fixture-node.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/22164746/City-IQ-multi-fixture-node-1024x576.jpg" alt="Over the next year, San Diego plans to replace 14,000 lights with LED fixtures, and 3,600 of those will be equipped with new intelligent nodes. " width="1024" height="576"></a><p><em>Smart lights, big city. Over the next year, San Diego plans to replace 14,000 lights with LED fixtures, and 3,600 will be equipped with new intelligent nodes. Image credit: GE Lighting</em></p></div>
<p>The intelligent lighting platform, which can sense sound, light and environmental conditions, offers a host of potential applications. But in the beginning, San Diego started with something really simple: parking. &ldquo;With sensored street lights, you can have more efficient use of your on-street parking,&rdquo; Graham says. &ldquo;You can better sense where cars are, and you can better understand parking and traffic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2014, the city ran a pilot test of just over 40 intelligent sensor nodes, which it installed downtown and used to monitor traffic. The goal, Graham says, was to enable people to find parking spaces with a minimum of effort. &ldquo;In a city like San Diego, there are real climate impacts to helping people get to parking quickly and efficiently, without idling or driving around,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>But parking is only the beginning. For instance, one application called <a href="http://www.gereports.com/12529-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ShotSpotter</a> uses the sensors&rsquo; sound and light detection capabilities to help law enforcement. &ldquo;Before they even arrive, first responders know immediately where shots were fired and triangulate where the shooter is, how many shooters there are, which direction they&rsquo;re shooting in,&rdquo; Ashe says. &ldquo;This is highly valuable information to help cities manage and mitigate crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the next year, the city will replace <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-me-government-0104-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">14,000 lights</a>&nbsp;with LED fixtures, and 3,600 will be equipped with the new intelligent nodes. &ldquo;The intelligent platform will cover 160 square miles, or half our city,&rdquo; Graham says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing 100 percent deployment in our underserved neighborhoods using community development block grants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The LED upgrade and intelligent platform deployment is expected to cost $30 million, and Graham estimates that it will save about $2.5 million worth of electricity per year. It will also further reduce maintenance costs, and the parking and shot spotting applications are likely to translate into cost savings and improved safety. But the major benefits of the new lights, Graham admits, are still unknown. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve created a platform to do things we can&rsquo;t even imagine today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He expects that the most significant new ideas will come from San Diegans. The city plans to make much of the information from the nodes openly available to app developers. &ldquo;We actually held a block party for streetlights,&rdquo; Graham says. &ldquo;We asked the public to tell us what they thought an intelligent city could be and how they thought their streetlights could improve their lives.&rdquo; It also held a hackathon to teach interested community members how to make their own apps that use the new information.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Graham hopes, the streetlights will become the key to San Diego&rsquo;s future. &ldquo;I see streetlights as the platform to transform our communities,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They can help us connect us to our citizens, to provide a future where we&rsquo;re able to better understand our neighborhoods and give them the services that they want.&rdquo;</p>]]></content>

	<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon may be the largest online retailer in the world, but the company is focused on having a posit...</p>]]></summary>
	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/18161656/PSP31505-09.jpg" alt="24 Internet-connected 2.85-103 wind turbines at the McLean's Mountain Wind Farm, Northland Power Project, Manitoulin Island, Lake Huron, Ontario, Canada. It is using data generated from Internet-connected sensors on the turbines. GE Renewable Energy and Northland work together: Data insights lead to proactive maintenance, less down time, and a more efficient wind farm."><p>Amazon may be the largest online retailer in the world, but the company is focused on having a positive impact on the ground as well. With an ever-expanding global network of fulfillment and data centers, Amazon has a growing demand for energy. Amazon also has an equal appetite for and commitment to renewable energy. In fact, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company&rsquo;s cloud computing business, has a long-term commitment to achieve 100 percent renewable energy usage for its global infrastructure footprint.</p>
<p>The company has become a big player in the renewable energy industry, recently announcing plans for its largest wind farm yet in a blustery corner of west Texas. When completed in late 2017, Amazon Wind Farm Texas will have the capacity to generate approximately 1 million megawatt-hours of electricity annually &mdash; enough to power almost 90,000 U.S. homes.</p>
<p>The wind farm, built by Lincoln Clean Energy, includes a fleet of GE wind turbines, and of the energy generated, 90 percent of the output will be sold to Amazon&rsquo;s fulfillment arm.</p>
<p>Scott Stalica, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/title/manager-commercial-operations-americas?trk=mprofile_title" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">manager for commercial operations in the Americas</a> at GE Renewable Energy points out that wind is not only good for the climate but also for the wallet. The cost of wind power is about one-third of what it was six years ago. &ldquo;Wind is very competitive versus alternative forms of generation,&rdquo; Stalica says.</p>
<div><a href="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/18161642/PSP31507-5832.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/18161642/PSP31507-5832-1024x683.jpg" alt="2.0-116 wind turbine installation in Shallowater, Texas, USA." width="1024" height="683"></a><p><em>&ldquo;Wind is very competitive versus alternative forms of generation,&rdquo; says GE&rsquo;s Stalica. Images credit: GE Renewable Energy</em></p></div>
<p>Data published by the&nbsp;Energy Information Administration shows that the cost of onshore wind energy &mdash; without federal tax and other financial incentives &mdash; is projected to reach $73.60 per megawatt-hour by 2020 and dropping as turbine technologies improve. That&rsquo;s slightly cheaper than conventional coal, which costs about <a href="http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$75.20</a> per megawatt-hour.</p>
<p>The opportunity for corporations to leverage the cost-competitive nature of renewable energy is growing. In 2015, AWS announced the construction of Amazon Solar Farm US East, Amazon Wind Farm Fowler Ridge, Amazon Wind Farm US Central and Amazon Wind Farm US East. In 2016, it announced five additional solar farms and one more wind farm, bringing the total number of such AWS projects to 10. With the addition of Amazon Wind Farm Texas, Amazon is poised to generate almost 3.6 million megawatt-hours of renewable energy by year-end 2017.</p>
<p>Scurry County, Texas, was selected as the site for the Amazon Wind Farm Texas because of its plentiful wind and affordable production and transmission costs. &ldquo;It makes good sense to build these large wind farms where the wind resource is strong and the local residents welcome the economic boost from such projects,&rdquo; says Paul Parkes, senior account manager in Wind Energy at GE, &ldquo;you need a really good wind resource, and it&rsquo;s got to be close to transmission lines to integrate and connect to the grid.&nbsp; This project is a model for connecting those dots and deriving the optimum energy solution for Amazon.&rdquo;</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/04100008/GettyImages-681903741-e1483467224373.jpg" alt="Roboter sitzt auf einer Stuhlreihe mit Karton, k&uuml;nstliche Intelligenz, Roboter, Technologie, Ersatz f&uuml;r Menschen, Maschine, modern, futuristisch, 3D Rendering, digital generiert, humanoid, menschlich, Business, Konzept,  Palme, Auszeit, K&uuml;ndigung, alles hinter sich lassen, erleichtert, traurig, Sorgen, fotorealistisch, Umzug, Ver&auml;nderung"><h4>The robots are coming for web programming. And coding schools will soon be obsolete. Even an engineer&nbsp;admits: with increasing automation, technology will soon replace the majority of tech jobs themselves.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I have a friend who can see the future. We were talking a few years ago about how far tooling and automation had come along in software engineering. He suggested that, in the very near future, there would be only two jobs in application development: user experience design (UX) and data science. Everything between would be automated. I was a bit skeptical at the time, but I have since come around to his point of view.</span></p>
<p><span>Since the first dot-com boom, there have been three specialized roles in web development: engineering, product management and UX. Engineers tended to be responsible for the data and functional layers while UX roles built the user interface. Coordination between them, and responsibility for the business overall, was managed by product managers. Students graduating from coding schools have been taught to think in these terms, and build apps that reflect this architecture.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, we see a different picture. We&rsquo;ve reached the point at which most web application programming is configuration. You configure tools, infrastructure and, frameworks, all mostly through the browser or in source control. What we used to build by hand is all available in package form now. Essentially, the job of today&rsquo;s developer is simply tying everything together. But how did we get here?</span></p>
<p><span>Sometime in the last five years, web architecture began to change. APIs, which even non-techies are coming to appreciate as the glue that binds the Internet, have enabled data sharing and application ecosystems on an unprecedented scale. Modern applications are now designed explicitly to share data with other systems, or to be extended in ways the API authors never intended. This is really &ldquo;Open Source,&rdquo; evolved to its next logical and glorious level.</span></p>
<p><span>JavaScript, the clunky browser-bound language we all hated 15 years ago, experienced something of a renaissance around 2010. Now, it&rsquo;s causing a revolution in the way apps are composed. Frameworks like Google&rsquo;s AngularJS or Facebook&rsquo;s ReactJS enable developers to build apps using flexible components, moving pieces of UX functionality around with ease. This results in apps that are both modular and extensible.</span></p>
<p><span>Cloud services like Amazon Web Services (AWS) make it possible for any development team to build and customize their own IT infrastructure. DevOps (a mash-up of Development and Operations that is basically shorthand for &ldquo;We do our own Ops now&rdquo;) is quickly erasing the need for a dedicated IT Operations department. The bearded wizards, who in the past spent their days crawling under desks, playing with network cabling or racking servers, are rapidly disappearing. They were gatekeepers to the application developers, controlling when and how our code would be deployed to production. Now, we can control everything through the AWS console.</span></p>
<p><span>As an engineer, it&rsquo;s not difficult to envision a future in which I can build an application in minutes, essentially with drag and drop, plugging components together in a browser-based configuration system. (Think IFTTT or Zapier, but for application development.) In such a world, there isn&rsquo;t a market for the old custom web application developer anymore.</span></p>
<p><span>Since the beginning of modern computing, each wave of engineering innovation has automated low-level tasks. Over time, high level and manual intensive tasks eventually become low-level tasks and modules. We moved from programming in assembly to the general programming language, from procedural programming to object-oriented programming, from hand-built servers to virtualization and cloud computing. </span></p>
<p><span>Now, we&rsquo;re moving a level up again. The only jobs in application development soon will be data science and customer experience design. Everything between them will be commodified.</span></p>

<div>
<p>What keeps you up at night?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>For many people worldwide, the answer is unemployment. Work is not just what allows us to sustain ourselves and our families: it expands our possibilities to be and do what we aspire to; it gives meaning and rhythm to our endeavors as part of a broader social contract. This is why in times of &ldquo;polycrisis&rdquo; and broader economic transformations, we dread losing what we hold so dear to a presumed automation apocalypse.</p>
<div><img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/03100000/v0p5ie0mRwtc3uv5gxjV8AtCcGFMBDbBj1934S4pyIQ-1024x428.png" alt="What are people most worried about?

Note: Representative sample of adults aged 16-64. September 2016: 18,014; August 2016: 18,042.</p></div>
<div>
<p>It is true: <a href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/the-risk-of-automation-for-jobs-in-oecd-countries_5jlz9h56dvq7-en?crawler=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">if a routine task can be performed cheaper, faster and better by a robot, there is a chance it will be</a>. What is also true &ndash; and even more certain &ndash; is that machines push us to specialize in our competitive advantages: more &ldquo;human&rdquo; work, creative and social intelligence, interpersonal and non-routine tasks are what makes us resilient and adaptive to change.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The future of work is about much more than automation. It is about equitable access to opportunities and accessibility. It is as much about finding employment as being entrepreneurial.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The future of work is about new ways to better preserve, share, spread and generate economic and social value. Advances in knowledge and technology have already empowered us with novel skills and solutions. They come down to three &ldquo;Cs&rdquo;: circular, collaborative and connective.</p>

<p>In the 21st century, progress is about circling the economic and social square. As we reach planetary boundaries and unemployment tops our hierarchy of concerns, we can no longer afford to waste our capital &ndash; whether natural or human. A circular economy can help put an end to that.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Investing to make buildings more sustainable, for example, means more energy-efficient houses that curb pollution and help families save more on their energy bill. At the same time, making apartments smarter brings construction workers &ndash; who were hard hit by the 2008 financial crisis &ndash; back into the labor market, and equips them with new technical skills.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In the same way, projects like <a href="https://thelastmile.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Last Mile Works</a> turn inmates &ndash; who are generally considered economically passive members of society &ndash; into digital entrepreneurs, making them economically active while they are incarcerated and preparing them for reintegration when they are out.</p>
<div><img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/03100000/NyJuOdSSPjhxBraTkwJU7GWAntFrNKB3w3ll-Wz-HZA.png" alt="Trends in Routine and Non-Routine Tasks in Occupations, United States Image: OECD Skills Outlook 2013, OECD." width="617" height="485"><p>Trends in Routine and Non-Routine Tasks in Occupations, United States. Image: OECD Skills Outlook 2013, OECD.</p></div>
<div>
<p>Preserving and uncovering value is not enough. It must be shared and accessible. This is ever more possible in an increasingly collaborative economy. Communities in Brooklyn, New York are creating a <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/07/04/482958497/how-blockchain-helps-brooklyn-dwellers-use-neighbors-solar-energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared economy for peer-to-peer energy exchange</a> to be more resilient and take neighbors out of energy poverty. So if a house&rsquo;s solar panels produce excess electricity that would generally go to waste, that surplus can be transferred to another, immediately and at a locally determined price. Similarly, as <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/epsc/publications/strategic-notes/towards-low-emission-mobility_en#footnote6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cars are on average parked 92 percent of the time</a>, why not share them with those who face obstacles to mobility and maximize everyone&rsquo;s benefits?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Finally, circular and collaborative innovations would not run as efficiently &ndash; if at all &ndash; had we not entered the connective economy. Thanks to connectivity, drones can be activated with one click to deliver medicines to rural areas, saving lives that an ambulance would have never reached. The most expensive part of that drone &ndash; which can be built <a href="http://m.crn.com/news/mobility/video/300082469/watch-a-drone-expert-and-hps-cto-build-a-drone-in-under-15-minutes.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in 15 minutes</a> &ndash; was probably the result of a worldwide hackathon that made it openly accessible and brought its cost down to $8. Connectivity has extended our imagination, allowing us to engineer solutions to seemingly unsolvable problems, and invent new professions that not long ago only belonged to science fiction.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Connectivity also means that we can invite more talent &ndash; all talent &ndash; into the future workplace. Initiatives like <a href="http://stevensinitiative.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stevens</a> use virtual exchanges to build cross-cultural skills and facilitate the integration of today&rsquo;s immigrant children into tomorrow&rsquo;s ever more diverse workforce. The elderly and people with disabilities can overcome physical limits and enter digital workplaces. Women can tear down the last barriers of gender discrimination.</p>

<p>When we look at the future of work with circular, collaborative and connective lenses, it stops looking like the automation apocalypse. These &ldquo;three Cs&rdquo; are not just attributes of an economy that may well yield minimum waste and maximum benefits for a larger number of people. They are qualities of a networked society in which we become individually stronger when we act collectively. They are critical skills that allow us to turn specific problems into systemic possibilities, and shape the future of work we want. They are the demonstration that, in the 21st century, solidarity is not just an ethical quality, but it makes social and economic sense. A robot cannot see and seize that.</p>

<p>Shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/776vxq/status_of_openage_open_source_engine_clone_of/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> was this video showing off some of the progress:</p>

<div></div>

<p>Looks like it's really starting to come together, which is awesome. As someone who spent hours playing AoE, this project is really exciting to me. Who knows, in another year perhaps this might be quite playable? Looks a bit rough right now of course, but very interesting to see the state of it right now.</p>

<p>Much like OpenMW (Morrowind), OpenRA (Red Alert, Command &amp; Conquer, Dune 2000) and others, it aims to be an engine reimplementation that requires the original game assets. According to a comment from a developer, they're targetting Age of Empires II first, with Age of Empires and Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds to follow.</p>]]></content>
