	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There's one force whose effects are so deeply entrenched in our everyday lives that we probably don't think much about it at all: gravity. Gravity is the force that causes attraction between masses. It's why when you drop a pen, it falls to the ground. But because gravitational force is proportional to the mass of the object, only large objects like planets create tangible attractions. This is why the study of gravity traditionally focused on massive objects like planets.</p>]]></content>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first laboratory generation of an astrophysical shock wave has been reported by scientists. To produce the wave, scientists used a laser to create a high-energy plasma -- a form of matter composed of atoms and charged atomic particles -- that expanded into a pre-existing magnetized plasma. The interaction created, within a few billionths of a second, a magnetized shock wave that expanded at a rate of more than 1 million miles per hour, congruent with shocks beyond the solar system.</p>]]></content>

This process called fibrogenesis can now be monitored noninvasively on a molecular level, as scientists report. They have created a new gadolinium-based probe for magnetic resonance imaging that specifically reports the proteins involved in fibrogenesis. The imaging method may provide a quantitative assessment of the formation of the potentially harmful scar tissue.</p>]]></content>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(Phys.org)&mdash;Using data from the first-ever gravitational waves detected last year, along with a theoretical analysis, physicists have shown that gravitational waves may oscillate between two different forms called "g" and "f"-type gravitational waves. The physicists explain that this phenomenon is analogous to the way that neutrinos oscillate between three distinct flavors&mdash;electron, muon, and tau. The oscillating gravitational waves arise in a modified theory of gravity called bimetric gravity, or "bigravity," and the physicists show that the oscillations may be detectable in future experiments.</p>]]></content>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span><strong><em>A recent NASA study outlines possible dedicated missions to the "ice giant' planets Uranus and Neptune.</em></strong></span></p>
<div><img src="http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Uranus_Neptune_Voyager2.jpg" alt="Uranus and Neptune as seen by Voyager 2" width="341" height="192" srcset="http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Uranus_Neptune_Voyager2.jpg 341w, http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/Uranus_Neptune_Voyager2-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px"><p>The outer solar system's "twin" planets looked very different when visited by Voyager 2 during the 1980s. Uranus, spinning on its side, had a nearly featureless disk. But Neptune displayed numerous bright and dark cloud patterns, including a hurricane-like featured dubbed the Great Dark Spot.</p></div>
<p>In 2003, NASA's Galileo mission came to an end by plunging into the atmosphere of Jupiter. Later this year, Cassini will follow suit, ending a decade and a half exploring Saturn and its moons. What's next for planetary exploration? Some researchers are pushing the next logical step:<a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6877" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> dedicated orbiters</a> for either or both of the "ice giant" outer planets, Uranus and Neptune.</p>
<p>NASA recently <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/icegiants/mission_study/Exec-Summary.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released a study</a> outlining just how such a mission (or missions) might unfold. The study is part of a lead up to the next Decadal Survey for 2022&ndash;32, a time when planetary scientists prioritize their wish list of future missions. The <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/game-plan-for-nasas-planetary-missions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">last Decadal Survey,</a> published by the National Research Council's Space Studies Board, covered opportunities from 2013 through 2022 and offered detailed development studies for the <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/nasa-narrows-down-mars-2020-rover-landing-sites/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mars 2020 rover</a> and Europa Clipper missions, though a dedicated Uranus orbiter was in the running as a distant third possibility.</p>
<p>"This study was one of many that will be performed to support the upcoming Decadal Survey deliberations," says Curt Niebur (NASA-HQ). "Once [the next Decadal Survey] is received by NASA, which should occur in 2022, NASA will begin considering which priorities it will pursue and how it will go about implementing them."</p>
<p>To date, only one spacecraft has visited the two outermost planets during its "grand tour" of the outer solar system: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Voyager 2</a>, which flew past Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989. But those visits were fleeting, giving planetary scientists brief glimpses of these distant worlds and moons as Voyager 2 headed out of the solar system. An Ice Giant Orbiter would, like Cassini, hang out and explore Uranus or Neptune long term.</p>
<h3>Road Trip to the Outer Solar System</h3>
<p>But it'll be a long haul, for sure. The problem with outer solar system exploration is, you want a spacecraft moving fast enough to reach its intended destination in a decade or so &mdash; but too much speed makes slowing down to enter orbit out of the question. New Horizons was a good case in point, as it took over 9 years to reach Pluto and Charon, whizzing by at 13.8 km per second, with only a hectic flyby period of exploration possible.</p>
<p>Instead, the mission to either Neptune or Uranus would launch in the 2030&mdash;31 time frame, taking 12 to 13 years to reach its target. The study calls for a 50-kg kilogram payload with three main instruments and an atmospheric probe similar to the one Galileo delivered to Jupiter. An "Ice Giant Orbiter" would utilize either traditional chemical propulsion on a slingshot trajectory, or perhaps a new solar-electric propulsion (SEP) system currently in development. Similar to the thrusters aboard NASA's Dawn mission, SEP propulsion offers the ability to maintain low thrust over long periods to build up speed.</p>

The ASRG generators on the orbiter's fuselage are no longer being considered. <br><em>NASA / JHU-APL</em></p></div>
<p>The study notes that an optimal window for a Uranus mission using a gravitational flyby assist of Jupiter exists in 2030 to 2034, while the same window for a Neptune mission runs from 2029 to 2030. Getting an orbiter to Uranus via an assist from Saturn could be carried out prior to 2028.</p>

<p>An Ice Giant Orbiter would be a $2 billion "Flagship mission, the top end of what NASA flies for planetary exploration. Other Flagship alumni included <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-blogs/cassini-survives-first-grand-finale-dive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cassini</a> and the Mars rover Curiosity. Other classes of NASA missions include mid-range ($500 million to $1 billion) New Frontiers missions such as Juno and OSIRIS-Rex and less-than-$500-million Discovery missions such as Lunar Prospector or Mercury's Messenger.</p>
<p>Scientists proposed a dedicated return to Uranus and Neptune early in the development of New Horizons. Such a &ldquo;New Horizons 2&rdquo; mission would've been a clone of the original, but it was later dropped from the program due to cost constraints.</p>
<p>Prime objectives for either mission would include a study of the planet's atmosphere, interior, and ring system as well as a survey of major moons and a hunt for more. Neptune's large, strange retrograde moon Triton is of particular interest, as researchers believe it's a captured Kuiper Belt object (KBO). At a minimum, an Ice Giant Orbiter mission would carry a mass spectrometer, wide and narrow angle cameras, a magnetometer and dust sensors.</p>

The thin rings are a composite of Voyager 2 images.<br> <em>NASA / Hubble / ESA</em></p></div>
<p>Uranus in particular would offer a challenging target, as the planet rotates tipped on one side. When Voyager 2 flew past Uranus in 1986, its southern hemisphere was in the middle of a 21-year-long summer and its northern latitudes lay hidden in shadow. A future spacecraft would arrive with the seasons reversed.</p>
<p>"The quick look we got from the Voyager 2 flybys of Uranus and Neptune taught us many things, but critical mysteries remain," says Mark Hofstadter (NASA/JPL). Compared to rocky terrestrial worlds or gas giants, ice-laden planets seem to be in a class by themselves. "Another important thing about Uranus and Neptune is that they seem similar to most of the exoplanets we are discovering around other stars," Hofstadter says. "To understand those distant planetary systems, we need to understand two examples that we can actually visit."</p>
<p>Planetary missions can provide a wealth of science discoveries for decades to come. For example, Georgia Institute of Technology researchers recently announced the magnetosphere of Uranus&nbsp;<a href="http://www.news.gatech.edu/2017/06/26/topsy-turvy-motion-creates-light-switch-effect-uranus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">behaves like a light switch</a> &mdash; a discovery that utilized Voyager 2 data gathered more than three decades ago.</p>

Its plutonium-powered RTG (Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator) is the black finned object protruding from the spacecraft to the left. <br><em>NASA/KSC</em></p></div>
<p>As with every outer solar system mission to Saturn and beyond, an Ice Giant Orbiter would be equipped with a plutonium-fueled Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/4_Mars_2020_MMRTG.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MMRTG</a>) for power far from the Sun. NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy announced in 2016 that the latter would <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/100875/u-s-to-restart-plutonium-production-for-deep-space-exploration/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">restart the production of Pu-238</a> (a different isotope than the fissile Pu-239 used in nuclear weapons) for space exploration, and this exotic cache should be available in the 2020s for space exploration. NASA also <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/106604/nasa-halts-work-on-its-new-nuclear-generator-for-deep-space-exploration/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">elected to halt development</a> of an Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) engine in 2013, which would've been four times as efficient as traditional RTGs. That tough decision was due to budget cuts, though the study anticipates enhanced eMMRTGs and a Heatshield for Extreme Entry and Environment Technology (HEEET) to be available for an ice-giant mission in the late 2020s.</p>
<p>This idea comes at an exciting time of crisis and opportunity for NASA and solar system exploration. On one hand, our eyes in the outer solar system are going dark, as Juno, Cassini, and Dawn all finish up their respective missions. NASA also seems to currently favor selecting smaller, low-cost missions such as Mars InSight, Lucy, and Psyche &mdash; perhaps in an effort to assure all of its &ldquo;eggs aren't in one basket,&rdquo; as opposed large expensive missions that might look attractive to the financial axe.</p>
<p>And perhaps, long mission timelines extending out to the 2040s are a bit depressing to children of the Apollo era... weren't we supposed to be vacationing on Mars by 2017?</p>
<p>Remarkably, interplanetary missions that could run through the midway point for this century are now under serious consideration.</p>

<p><span>Sure, you know the basic idea: A solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between you and the Sun, hiding part or all of the Sun from view. It</span>&rsquo;<span>s weird, it</span>&rsquo;<span>s unearthly, and it scared the bejeezus out of our ancestors who didn</span>&rsquo;<span>t know what was going on. The stories they made up to explain eclipses were hair-raising. The drive to actually <i>understand</i> eclipses </span>&mdash; well enough to predict them! &mdash; <span>was one of the drivers of ancient astronomy, and thus one of the drivers for the whole idea of science itself.</span></p>

<p><span>One breakthrough was grasping the scene from another viewpoint: The Moon is a sunlit ball and casts a shadow, and we see an eclipse of the Sun when the Moon</span>&rsquo;<span>s shadow sweeps over us, like in the diagram above.</span></p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s more to it than that &mdash; and if you want a fuller picture of what&rsquo;s going to occur on August 21st, read on.</p>
<h3>Celestial Geometry</h3>
<p>First off: The Moon orbits around Earth about once a month. This repeating journey brings the Moon close to our line of sight to the Sun at the time of<span>&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;new Moon.&rdquo; At that time the sunlit side of the Moon faces directly away from us; the Moon shows us only its darkened night side. And we can&rsquo;t <i>see</i> even that &mdash; because when the Moon is near our line of sight to the Sun, it&rsquo;s hidden in the Sun&rsquo;s dazzling glare in the bright blue daytime sky.</p>
<p>Usually the Moon misses the Sun in these monthly near-lineups (for reasons I&rsquo;ll get to later). But about every six months on average, at least part of the new Moon crosses at least part of the Sun&rsquo;s face as seen from somewhere on Earth. Hence a solar eclipse.</p>
<p>If the Moon crosses the Sun off center as seen from your location, you get only a <i>partial </i>solar eclipse, with the Moon&rsquo;s silhouette making what looks like a dent in the Sun&rsquo;s brilliant face. A deep partial eclipse, where the dent is big, turns the Sun into a dazzling crescent.</p>
<p>But the really good stuff happens if the Moon crosses the Sun nearly dead center as seen from your location. Then you may get a <i>total </i>solar eclipse, blacking out the Sun completely for anything from a few seconds up to 7&frac12; minutes.</p>
<p>A total eclipse also has partial-eclipse phases before and afterward. The partial phases take their time; the whole event usually runs about 3 hours from beginning to end.</p>

This happens four times from start to finish. <br>S&amp;T <em>illustration: Leah Tiscione/Gregg Dinderman</em></p></div>
<h3>What To Expect</h3>
<p>A total eclipse is much more spectacular than a partial &mdash; not only because the sky and land get much darker, but especially because during totality we get a rare look at the Sun&rsquo;s intricate, feathery <i>corona:</i> its outermost atmosphere, made mostly of free electrons and protons that are trapped in the Sun&rsquo;s loopy, streaky magnetic field.</p>
<p>The partial phase of a solar eclipse can be seen from a large swath of the world. On August 21st that includes all of North America, Central America, and the northern part of South America.</p>
<div><a href="http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/how-why-eclipse-earth-image.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/how-why-eclipse-earth-image.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="373" srcset="http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/how-why-eclipse-earth-image.jpg 600w, http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/how-why-eclipse-earth-image-300x187.jpg 300w, http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/how-why-eclipse-earth-image-579x360.jpg 579w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a><p>Here's how the Moon's shadow looked as it crossed Earth during the total solar eclipse on March 9, 2016. The islands of Indonesia are at lower left.<br><em>JMA/SSEC/University of Wisconsin at Madison</em></p></div>
<p>But totality is reserved for a much smaller area. The dark center of the Moon&rsquo;s shadow, the part where the Sun is completely blocked (the shadow&rsquo;s <i>umbra</i>) is never more than about 160 miles wide by the time it reaches Earth, usually less. On August 21st, the narrow shadow-patch of totality will sweep across the United States from the Pacific to the Atlantic. That&rsquo;s the part for which so many people are preparing to travel.</p>
<h3>Your Eyes Are Worth Keeping</h3>
<p><span>As you&rsquo;ve probably heard many times, staring at the Sun&rsquo;s dazzling surface, </span>even when only part of it is in view, can damage your eyes and leave a permanent blind spot in your vision. Never stare at the bright Sun, whether a partial eclipse is in progress or not.</p>
<p>Instead, during the partial phases you need to look through a safe solar filter. One example is the kind that<span>&rsquo;</span>s made to go over the front of a telescope. For viewing just by eye, all of the inexpensive little &ldquo;eclipse glasses&rdquo; that we have tested do just fine.</p>
<p>Or you can watch an image of the Sun as projected onto a piece of paper &mdash; using either a pinhole, which gives a very small, dim, crude image, or a pair of binoculars or a telescope, which project a much bigger, brighter, and sharper image onto paper.</p>
<p>While the Sun is hidden during totality, no filter is needed!<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>The Workings in 3D</h3>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t we get a solar eclipse at <i>every</i> new Moon, you might ask? How does the Moon usually sneak by unseen?</p>
<p>The answer is that the solar system is not perfectly flat. In particular, the orbits of the Moon and Earth do not lie in quite the same plane. If you drew Earth&rsquo;s orbit around the Sun on a flat sheet of paper, the Moon&rsquo;s orbit around Earth would be tilted 5&deg; out of the paper, floating a little above and below it except where the planes intersect. Eclipses happen only when both the Sun and Moon are close to this intersection, along what&rsquo;s called the <i>line of nodes</i>.</p>
<p>A 5&deg; tilt might not seem like much. But it&rsquo;s 10 times the &frac12;&deg; width of the Sun as we see it in the sky. So, when new Moon happens somewhere other than at the line of nodes, the Moon has plenty of room to pass north or south of the Sun without crossing it. That&rsquo;s why solar eclipses are uncommon.</p>
<h3>Eclipses of the Moon</h3>
<div><a href="http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/sunmoon.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/sunmoon.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="353" srcset="http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/sunmoon.jpg 600w, http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/sunmoon-161x190.jpg 161w, http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/sunmoon-306x360.jpg 306w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a><p><em>Sky &amp; Telescope</em></p></div>
<p>What about <i>lunar</i> eclipses? I haven&rsquo;t mentioned them yet. These happen whenever the Earth-Moon geometry is reversed: when the <i>Moon</i> passes through <i>Earth&rsquo;s</i> shadow. This is such a different kind of event that solar and lunar eclipses hardly both deserve to have the same name &ldquo;eclipse&rdquo;!</p>
<p><span>Why not? With a lunar eclipse, </span>instead of something hiding something else as seen by you, you&rsquo;re just seeing the Moon get shaded. And, the Moon never goes completely dark. Think of covering the Sun in the sky with your hand, versus looking at your hand&rsquo;s shadow on the ground. Two different things.</p>
<p>During a lunar eclipse, people on the entire side of the world facing the Moon all see the same thing happening to the Moon at once, just like friends around you can all see the shadow of your hand on the ground. But when you cover the Sun with your hand, the Sun disappears only for you, not for the people off to the side. That&rsquo;s part of what makes a total solar eclipse rare and special.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span><strong><em>From its dynamic atmosphere to its hidden depths, Juno reveals Jupiter as never before.</em></strong></span></p>
<div><img src="http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/m17-059.jpg" alt="Juno at Jupiter" width="350" height="200" srcset="http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/m17-059.jpg 480w, http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/m17-059-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px"><p>An artist's conception of Juno in orbit around Jupiter. <br> <em>NASA</em></p></div>
<p>Forget what you thought you knew about Jupiter. The first science results are in from NASA's Juno spacecraft, currently in orbit around Jove. The findings were <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/05/jupiter-s-skies-are-peppered-electron-streams-ammonia-plumes-and-massive-storms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published in this week's<i> Science</i></a> and <i>Geophysical Research Letters</i> today, along with a salvo of press releases.</p>
<p>For starters, there was this eye-popping, never-before-seen sequence of Jupiter's aurorae, captured by Juno's Ultraviolet Spectrograph. The long-tailed "comet" on the left is the footprint of an electromagnetic connection to the moon Io:</p>
<div></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Juno's orbit takes it around Jupiter once every 53 days, from a <em>perijove</em> 2,500 miles (4,000 km) above the Jovian cloud tops, to a five million mile (8 million km) <em>apojove</em> out past the orbit of Callisto. Original plans called for Juno to enter a tighter, 14-day-long orbit around Jupiter, but NASA decided to <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/juno-stay-current-orbit-jupiter/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">keep Juno in its present initial capture orbit</a> after a helium valve engine anomaly turned up during a course correction burn last October. Juno will complete eight more planned orbits and was granted a brief reprieve as its final disposal via atmospheric entry won't occur now until July 2018.</p>
<h3>Comparing Gas Giants</h3>
<p>It has been a thrilling ride, as <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/juno-swoops-past-jupiters-south-pole/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Juno scans Jupiter</a> in detail from pole-to-pole once every pass in a whirlwind six hour science phase. Juno completed its sixth perijove pass earlier this week. Unlike what <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-blogs/cassini-survives-first-grand-finale-dive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cassini is seeing on its Grand Finale orbits</a> around Saturn, however, the poles of Jupiter are chaotic and complex.</p>

<p>"We knew, going in, that Jupiter that Jupiter would throw us some curves," says Scott Bolton (Southwest Research Institute) in a NASA <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/a-whole-new-jupiter-first-science-results-from-nasa-s-juno-mission" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>. "But now that we are here we are finding that Jupiter can throw the heat, as well as knuckleballs and sliders. There is so much going on here that we didn't expect, that we have to take a step back and begin to rethink of this as a whole new Jupiter."</p>

<p>Thus far, Juno has delivered unparalleled views of Jupiter's poles, revealing complex cloud festoons and enigmatic white ovals and cyclones the size of the Earth. Pioneer 11 in 1974 and the Ulysses flyby of Jupiter in 1992 provided the only other polar views of Jupiter, and these were from much greater distances.</p>
<p>Here's a highlight rundown of the first science findings of Juno at Jupiter:</p>

<p><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Sounding by Juno's Microwave Radiometer instrument points towards a robust cycling of the ammonia clouds shrouding the planet and an ammonia-based weather cycle extending deep below the cloud tops. This ammonia stream is evident racing around Jupiter's equatorial belt &mdash; Jupiter rotates once every 10 hours, the fastest spin of any planet in the solar system &mdash; but Juno sees this ammonia belt extending deeper than expected, to a depth of at least 300 km. In fact, the main ammonia-rich plume near the Northern Equatorial Belt resembles a larger version of the <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/research/equable/hadley.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hadley Cell circulation</a> seen in the equatorial regions of the Earth.</p>
<p>Just what powers the swirling storms near Jupiter's poles, and why does the northern pole of the planet differ dramatically from the south? "We're questioning whether this is a dynamic system," Says Bolton in a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/a-whole-new-jupiter-first-science-results-from-nasa-s-juno-mission" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent press release</a>. "Are we seeing just one stage, and over the next year, we're going to watch it disappear, or is this a stable configuration and these storms are circulating around one another?"</p>

The upper meteorological layer, versus a possible deep rocky core. <br><em>NASA / JPL / SwRI</em></p></div>
<p><strong>Gravitational field:</strong> The orbit of Juno makes it an ideal platform to plumb the extent of Jupiter's gravitational field, giving scientists a chance to understand the interior structure of the planet. By carefully tracking Juno's motion, engineers back on Earth can detect minute changes in the planet's attractive force on the spacecraft.</p>
<p>Previous models featured sharp demarcations between transition layers, with perhaps a metallic liquid hydrogen core enveloping a bizarre high pressure zone of helium precipitation. Juno's preliminary findings, however, challenge this assertion and suggest instead a large but indistinct &ldquo;fuzzy&rdquo; core diluted with layers that are intermixing. Understanding whether or not Jupiter has a solid core is a key mystery in planetary formation.</p>
<div><img src="http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/07_jack_1.jpg" alt="Jupiter magnetic field" width="600" height="456" srcset="http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/07_jack_1.jpg 600w, http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/07_jack_1-250x190.jpg 250w, http://wwwcdn.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/07_jack_1-474x360.jpg 474w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><p>Jupiter's lumpy magnetic field from north to south. The black line represents the track on Jupiter directly below the spacecraft during one of its perijove passes.<br><em>NASA / MSSS / SwRI / Caltech</em></p></div>
<p>Finally, Juno delivered another surprise. Jupiter's magnetic field is not only almost twice as strong as expected in spots, but it's not uniform. These results come from Juno's magnetometer and microwave radiometer. Specifically, the field strength peaks near 8 to 9 gauss, nearly twice the expected 5 gauss. Earth's magnetic field is a paltry 0.3 to 0.7 gauss: for comparison, a typical refrigerator magnet has a field of about 50 gauss, powerful over short distances. Juno also recorded variances in the magnetic field map surrounding Jupiter up to 2 gauss. This strongly suggests that the dynamo generating the field is relatively shallow, rather than the deep-seated engine driving the magnetic field emanating from Earth's core.</p>

<p><strong>Radiation:</strong> The mission has provided another unique plus, with spectacular closeups of aurora over both poles of Jupiter. Jovian aurora have been seen by the Hubble Space Telescope orbiting the Earth, and Juno has now chronicled these up close, along with the footprint of the powerful Io flux tube extending from the innermost Galilean moon. JunoCam and Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) are the prime instruments monitoring Jovian aurora.</p>
<p>Thus far, Juno has navigated through the intense radiation field surrounding Jupiter relatively unscathed. The main spacecraft bus is shielded within a sturdy titanium housing.</p>
<p>Juno is the first outer solar system mission powered by three solar panels instead on a plutonium-fueled generator. And those panels are huge, each 29&frac12; feet (9 meters) long. Engineers noticed "flecks of light" traveling across Juno's navigational star camera field of view, which were traced back to micrometeoroid impacts along its three huge solar panels. Like with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/lisa-pathfinder-gravitational-waves-space-dust/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LISA Pathfinder</a>, researchers soon realized that Juno can also serve as a micrometeoroid detector, the largest ever flown.</p>
<p>But that's not all that the star trackers saw. Gaze upon the Jovian ring system seen, for the first time, from the planet's perspective:</p>

Captured by Juno's Stellar Reference Unit SRU-1, watchers will note the Belt of Orion asterism (lower right) and the bright star Betelgeuse (just above the ring). <br><em>NASA / MSSS / Caltech / SwRI</em></p></div>
<p>More science is sure to come, as researchers analyze Juno data. We've got just over a year remaining to this exciting mission to unravel the secrets of the largest planet in the solar system.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the first time in the world, scientists have explored the magnetic field in the upper solar atmosphere by observing the polarization of ultraviolet light from the Sun. They accomplished this by analyzing data taken by the CLASP sounding rocket experiment during its 5-minute flight in space on September 3, 2015. The data show that the structures of the solar chromosphere and transition region are more complicated than expected. Now that ultraviolet spectropolarimetry, the method used in the CLASP project, has been proven to work, it can be used in future investigations of the magnetic fields in the upper chromosphere and the transition region to better understand activity in the solar atmosphere.</p>]]></content>

<p>Get set for a wild ride.</p>
<p>After almost 20 years in space, Cassini will enter the &ldquo;beginning of the end.&rdquo; It starts in late April with the first of a series of <a href="https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/grand-finale/overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grand Finale Orbits</a>. Cassini promises to deliver amazing science as well as never-before-seen views of the ringed planet right up until the very end.</p>
<p>"I feel a little sad that Cassini will end," said Jim Green (NASA) during a press conference, "but I'm also quite optimistic that we're going to discover some new and really exciting science as we enter a region that we've never probed before."</p>
<p>The action starts on April 22nd with a final Titan flyby, which sets up Cassini for its 22 final orbits around Saturn. This flyby is also the closest for Cassini since 2010, as the spacecraft will skim just 615 miles (990 km) above the shrouded moon. Then, on April 26, Cassini will take the plunge, diving through the 1,500-mile-wide gap between the innermost D-ring and Saturn's cloudtops at <a href="https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/2990/cassinis-two-speeds/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">70,000 mph</a>. The spacecraft will continue to make similar passes once a week for the mission's final duration. These <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6803" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grand Finale orbits</a> will take Cassini from a periapsis (closest approach) of 39,000 miles from Saturn's center out to an apoapsis of 87,000 miles, past the outermost edge of the F-ring.</p>
<p>Even if Cassini gets pummeled with ring debris during these daring final passes, the ballistic trajectory assures its final disposal. Engineers will use Cassini's large main High Gain Antenna as a shield on each pass through the ring plane.</p>
<p>"The planned conclusion for Cassini's journey was far and away the preferred choice for the mission's scientists," says Linda Spilker (NASA-JPL) in a recent <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6803" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>. "Cassini will make some of its most extraordinary observations at the end of its long life."</p>
<p>Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory previewed <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6799" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cassini's Grand Finale</a> series of orbits on Tuesday, showcasing just what to expect from the beginning of Cassini's end.</p>
<div></div>
<p>In some ways, the final orbits mark a whole new mission, taking Cassini to new territory. Scientists aim to get a lot of data out of these final orbits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cassini will map Saturn's magnetic and gravitational fields in order to probe the planet's internal structure and refine our understanding of its internal rotation</li>
<li>Scientists will analyze the mass and structure of Saturn's rings using a series of radio occultations on each successive pass</li>
<li>The spacecraft will sample the charged particles funneled by Saturn's magnetic field from the rings into the planet's atmosphere</li>
</ul>
<p>Expect some dazzling images of Saturnian cloudtops as well, as the spacecraft gets up close and personal to the planet like never before.</p>

<p>Over the past few months, the <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/nasa-cassini-ring-grazing-orbits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ring Grazing Orbits</a> have given us an amazing set of views. We've also had some great recent views of the enigmatic &ldquo;<a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/cassini-amazing-views-saturn-hexagon/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">polar hexagon</a>,&rdquo; as well as moon close-ups of <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/welcome-pan-saturns-ravioli-shaped-moon/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ravioli-shaped Pan</a> and <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/cassini-spies-daphnis-making-waves/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Daphnis</a> as it braids the Keeler Gap.</p>
<p>Expect close flybys of the tiny moonlets Epimetheus, Pandora, and Atlas on April 5th, with more to come.</p>
<h3>Space Science Workhorse</h3>
<p>Launched on October 15, 1997, atop a Titan IVB rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Cassini made a gravity-assist flyby past Venus (1998 and 1999), Earth (1999), and Jupiter (2000) before arriving in orbit around Saturn on July 1, 2004. Cassini is the fourth mission to visit Saturn, a legacy that started with the Pioneer 11 flyby in 1979 and continued with Voyager 1 (1980) and Voyager 2 (1981).</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessors, though, Cassini entered orbit around Saturn, enabling scientists to study longterm changes on the planet. <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/hooray-for-huygens/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cassini also delivered the European Space Agency's Huygens lander to Titan</a>, which made the most distant landing on another world on January 14, 2005. Cassini gave us close-up views of worlds only glimpsed during previous flybys, revealed seven new moons orbiting Saturn, ice geyser plumes on Enceladus, methane lakes on Titan, spokes in the rings of Saturn, and much more.</p>
<p>But Cassini and the team of scientists behind it have a poetic side, as well, revealing a glorious back-lit Saturn as the spacecraft passed through the planet's shadow. Then, on July 19, 2013, researchers turned Cassini's cameras back on its world of origin: It imaged Earth just beyond Saturn's limb during <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=pia17172" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Day the Earth Smiled campaign</a>.</p>

<p>Now, the end is near: September 15, 2017, at 10:44 UT is&nbsp; when Cassini will plunge into Saturn's dense atmosphere.</p>
<p>It'll be sad to see Cassini go, but the maneuver is a necessary precaution to avoid any future contamination of Enceladus or Titan, worlds which could harbor life. Cassini will beam back its final images just a few hours prior to destruction, and its mass spectrometer will take data during its fiery atmospheric plunge. Signal travel time at the end will be 83 minutes.</p>
<p>"It's going to be hard to say goodbye to this plucky spacecraft that delivered some amazing science," says Spilker. Researchers (and science writers, too!) have grown up with the Cassini mission.</p>
<p>When will we return? Well, while there's been talk of dedicated missions to Titan or Enceladus, these are at best a decade or more away. Solar power is too feeble to power a spacecraft in the outer solar system, and the U.S. Department of Energy only recently announced a <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/100875/u-s-to-restart-plutonium-production-for-deep-space-exploration/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">restart of plutonium production</a> for NASA in 2013.</p>
<p>Enjoy these final few months, as Cassini gives us some unparalleled views of the original Ringed Planet.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mammalian cells are optimally adapted to gravity. But what happens in the microgravity environment of space if the earth's pull disappears? Previously, many experiments exhibited cell changes &ndash; after hours or even days in zero gravity. Astronauts, however, returned to Earth without any severe health problems after long missions in space, which begs the question as to how capable cells are of adapting to changes in gravity. Based on real-time readings on the ISS, UZH scientists can now reveal that cells are able to respond to changes in gravitational conditions extremely quickly and keep on functioning. Therefore, the study also provides direct evidence that certain cell functions are linked to gravity.&nbsp;</p>]]></content>
