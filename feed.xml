	<title type="html">From Light To Bright: San Diego Is Building The Worldâ€™s Largest Municipal Internet Of Things</title>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/22164454/city-scape.jpg" alt=""><p>San Diego&rsquo;s newest streetlights might not look all that special &mdash; and that&rsquo;s exactly the point. Designed to blend in with the rest of the city&rsquo;s outdoor lighting, they&rsquo;re easy to overlook. Under the surface, though, the LED fixtures are actually data-gathering machines.&nbsp;They will allow San Diego to build the largest municipal internet-of-things network in the world.</p>
<p>San Diego&rsquo;s digital lighting revolution started as a modest solution to a common problem. &ldquo;We were broke,&rdquo; says David Graham, San Diego&rsquo;s deputy chief operating officer. &ldquo;In the early 2000s, we went through about a decade of fiscal crisis, and we were trying to find ways to be more efficient, save money and reduce energy usage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One idea to save money was to replace the yellow glow of the city&rsquo;s old sodium vapor streetlamps with efficient new LED lights. In addition to providing cleaner, broader-spectrum light, the new fixtures used 60 percent less energy and slashed maintenance needs because of their longer life spans. The city <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/environment/sdut-san-diego-swtiches-green-street-lights-2011sep19-htmlstory.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">replaced more than 35,000 lights</a>, yielding an estimated $2.2 million in savings per year.</p>
<p>But the new fixtures also brought to light new problems. &ldquo;We know when a traditional light bulb isn&rsquo;t working, because it burns out,&rdquo; says Austin Ashe, general manager of Current, powered by GE&rsquo;s Intelligent Cities program. &ldquo;But an LED doesn&rsquo;t burn out. It just degrades over time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As GE replaced the lights, San Diego asked for a better way to monitor the LEDs. The answer, and the first step toward connecting the city&rsquo;s lighting infrastructure, was LightGrid. This adaptive control program connected streetlights through a wireless network, enabling the city to monitor and manage lights remotely. &ldquo;Now we know exactly how much energy a streetlight is using,&rdquo; Graham says. &ldquo;We know if it&rsquo;s out. We can brighten or dim it, depending on environmental factors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But LightGrid was just the first step. San Diego soon discovered it could reap additional benefits through expanded connectivity. San Diego agreed to be the first city to <a href="http://www.gereports.com/smart-streets-are-made-of-these-san-diego-deploys-americas-first-intelligent-lighting-system/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pilot GE&rsquo;s intelligent cities platform</a> &mdash; enabled by adding nodes holding multiple sensors to streetlights. The nodes connected to Predix, GE&rsquo;s operating system for the Industrial Internet, to process the metadata collected by the sensors.</p>
<div><a href="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/22164746/City-IQ-multi-fixture-node.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/22164746/City-IQ-multi-fixture-node-1024x576.jpg" alt="Over the next year, San Diego plans to replace 14,000 lights with LED fixtures, and 3,600 of those will be equipped with new intelligent nodes. " width="1024" height="576"></a><p><em>Smart lights, big city. Over the next year, San Diego plans to replace 14,000 lights with LED fixtures, and 3,600 will be equipped with new intelligent nodes.

<p>The intelligent lighting platform, which can sense sound, light and environmental conditions, offers a host of potential applications. But in the beginning, San Diego started with something really simple: parking. &ldquo;With sensored street lights, you can have more efficient use of your on-street parking,&rdquo; Graham says. &ldquo;You can better sense where cars are, and you can better understand parking and traffic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2014, the city ran a pilot test of just over 40 intelligent sensor nodes, which it installed downtown and used to monitor traffic. The goal, Graham says, was to enable people to find parking spaces with a minimum of effort. &ldquo;In a city like San Diego, there are real climate impacts to helping people get to parking quickly and efficiently, without idling or driving around,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>But parking is only the beginning. For instance, one application called <a href="http://www.gereports.com/12529-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ShotSpotter</a> uses the sensors&rsquo; sound and light detection capabilities to help law enforcement. &ldquo;Before they even arrive, first responders know immediately where shots were fired and triangulate where the shooter is, how many shooters there are, which direction they&rsquo;re shooting in,&rdquo; Ashe says. &ldquo;This is highly valuable information to help cities manage and mitigate crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the next year, the city will replace <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-me-government-0104-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">14,000 lights</a>&nbsp;with LED fixtures, and 3,600 will be equipped with the new intelligent nodes. &ldquo;The intelligent platform will cover 160 square miles, or half our city,&rdquo; Graham says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing 100 percent deployment in our underserved neighborhoods using community development block grants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The LED upgrade and intelligent platform deployment is expected to cost $30 million, and Graham estimates that it will save about $2.5 million worth of electricity per year. It will also further reduce maintenance costs, and the parking and shot spotting applications are likely to translate into cost savings and improved safety. But the major benefits of the new lights, Graham admits, are still unknown. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve created a platform to do things we can&rsquo;t even imagine today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He expects that the most significant new ideas will come from San Diegans. The city plans to make much of the information from the nodes openly available to app developers. &ldquo;We actually held a block party for streetlights,&rdquo; Graham says. &ldquo;We asked the public to tell us what they thought an intelligent city could be and how they thought their streetlights could improve their lives.&rdquo; It also held a hackathon to teach interested community members how to make their own apps that use the new information.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Graham hopes, the streetlights will become the key to San Diego&rsquo;s future. &ldquo;I see streetlights as the platform to transform our communities,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They can help us connect us to our citizens, to provide a future where we&rsquo;re able to better understand our neighborhoods and give them the services that they want.&rdquo;</p>]]></content>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/18161656/PSP31505-09.jpg" alt="24 Internet-connected 2.85-103 wind turbines at the McLean's Mountain Wind Farm, Northland Power Project, Manitoulin Island, Lake Huron, Ontario, Canada. It is using data generated from Internet-connected sensors on the turbines. GE Renewable Energy and Northland work together: Data insights lead to proactive maintenance, less down time, and a more efficient wind farm."><p>Amazon may be the largest online retailer in the world, but the company is focused on having a positive impact on the ground as well. With an ever-expanding global network of fulfillment and data centers, Amazon has a growing demand for energy. Amazon also has an equal appetite for and commitment to renewable energy. In fact, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company&rsquo;s cloud computing business, has a long-term commitment to achieve 100 percent renewable energy usage for its global infrastructure footprint.</p>
<p>The company has become a big player in the renewable energy industry, recently announcing plans for its largest wind farm yet in a blustery corner of west Texas. When completed in late 2017, Amazon Wind Farm Texas will have the capacity to generate approximately 1 million megawatt-hours of electricity annually &mdash; enough to power almost 90,000 U.S. homes.</p>
<p>The wind farm, built by Lincoln Clean Energy, includes a fleet of GE wind turbines, and of the energy generated, 90 percent of the output will be sold to Amazon&rsquo;s fulfillment arm.</p>
<p>Scott Stalica, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/title/manager-commercial-operations-americas?trk=mprofile_title" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">manager for commercial operations in the Americas</a> at GE Renewable Energy points out that wind is not only good for the climate but also for the wallet. The cost of wind power is about one-third of what it was six years ago. &ldquo;Wind is very competitive versus alternative forms of generation,&rdquo; Stalica says.</p>
<div><a href="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/18161642/PSP31507-5832.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/18161642/PSP31507-5832-1024x683.jpg" alt="2.0-116 wind turbine installation in Shallowater, Texas, USA." width="1024" height="683"></a><p><em>&ldquo;Wind is very competitive versus alternative forms of generation,&rdquo; says GE&rsquo;s Stalica. Images credit: GE Renewable Energy</em></p></div>
<p>Data published by the&nbsp;Energy Information Administration shows that the cost of onshore wind energy &mdash; without federal tax and other financial incentives &mdash; is projected to reach $73.60 per megawatt-hour by 2020 and dropping as turbine technologies improve. That&rsquo;s slightly cheaper than conventional coal, which costs about <a href="http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$75.20</a> per megawatt-hour.</p>
<p>The opportunity for corporations to leverage the cost-competitive nature of renewable energy is growing. In 2015, AWS announced the construction of Amazon Solar Farm US East, Amazon Wind Farm Fowler Ridge, Amazon Wind Farm US Central and Amazon Wind Farm US East. In 2016, it announced five additional solar farms and one more wind farm, bringing the total number of such AWS projects to 10. With the addition of Amazon Wind Farm Texas, Amazon is poised to generate almost 3.6 million megawatt-hours of renewable energy by year-end 2017.</p>
<p>Scurry County, Texas, was selected as the site for the Amazon Wind Farm Texas because of its plentiful wind and affordable production and transmission costs. &ldquo;It makes good sense to build these large wind farms where the wind resource is strong and the local residents welcome the economic boost from such projects,&rdquo; says Paul Parkes, senior account manager in Wind Energy at GE, &ldquo;you need a really good wind resource, and it&rsquo;s got to be close to transmission lines to integrate and connect to the grid.&nbsp; This project is a model for connecting those dots and deriving the optimum energy solution for Amazon.&rdquo;</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/04100008/GettyImages-681903741-e1483467224373.jpg" alt="Roboter sitzt auf einer Stuhlreihe mit Karton, k&uuml;nstliche Intelligenz, Roboter, Technologie, Ersatz f&uuml;r Menschen, Maschine, modern, futuristisch, 3D Rendering, digital generiert, humanoid, menschlich, Business, Konzept,  Palme, Auszeit, K&uuml;ndigung, alles hinter sich lassen, erleichtert, traurig, Sorgen, fotorealistisch, Umzug, Ver&auml;nderung"><h4>The robots are coming for web programming. And coding schools will soon be obsolete. Even an engineer&nbsp;admits: with increasing automation, technology will soon replace the majority of tech jobs themselves.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I have a friend who can see the future. We were talking a few years ago about how far tooling and automation had come along in software engineering. He suggested that, in the very near future, there would be only two jobs in application development: user experience design (UX) and data science. Everything between would be automated. I was a bit skeptical at the time, but I have since come around to his point of view.</span></p>
<p><span>Since the first dot-com boom, there have been three specialized roles in web development: engineering, product management and UX. Engineers tended to be responsible for the data and functional layers while UX roles built the user interface. Coordination between them, and responsibility for the business overall, was managed by product managers. Students graduating from coding schools have been taught to think in these terms, and build apps that reflect this architecture.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, we see a different picture. We&rsquo;ve reached the point at which most web application programming is configuration. You configure tools, infrastructure and, frameworks, all mostly through the browser or in source control. What we used to build by hand is all available in package form now. Essentially, the job of today&rsquo;s developer is simply tying everything together. But how did we get here?</span></p>
<p><span>Sometime in the last five years, web architecture began to change. APIs, which even non-techies are coming to appreciate as the glue that binds the Internet, have enabled data sharing and application ecosystems on an unprecedented scale. Modern applications are now designed explicitly to share data with other systems, or to be extended in ways the API authors never intended. This is really &ldquo;Open Source,&rdquo; evolved to its next logical and glorious level.</span></p>
<p><span>JavaScript, the clunky browser-bound language we all hated 15 years ago, experienced something of a renaissance around 2010. Now, it&rsquo;s causing a revolution in the way apps are composed. Frameworks like Google&rsquo;s AngularJS or Facebook&rsquo;s ReactJS enable developers to build apps using flexible components, moving pieces of UX functionality around with ease. This results in apps that are both modular and extensible.</span></p>
<p><span>Cloud services like Amazon Web Services (AWS) make it possible for any development team to build and customize their own IT infrastructure. DevOps (a mash-up of Development and Operations that is basically shorthand for &ldquo;We do our own Ops now&rdquo;) is quickly erasing the need for a dedicated IT Operations department. The bearded wizards, who in the past spent their days crawling under desks, playing with network cabling or racking servers, are rapidly disappearing. They were gatekeepers to the application developers, controlling when and how our code would be deployed to production. Now, we can control everything through the AWS console.</span></p>
<p><span>As an engineer, it&rsquo;s not difficult to envision a future in which I can build an application in minutes, essentially with drag and drop, plugging components together in a browser-based configuration system. (Think IFTTT or Zapier, but for application development.) In such a world, there isn&rsquo;t a market for the old custom web application developer anymore.</span></p>
<p><span>Since the beginning of modern computing, each wave of engineering innovation has automated low-level tasks. Over time, high level and manual intensive tasks eventually become low-level tasks and modules. We moved from programming in assembly to the general programming language, from procedural programming to object-oriented programming, from hand-built servers to virtualization and cloud computing. </span></p>
<p><span>Now, we&rsquo;re moving a level up again. The only jobs in application development soon will be data science and customer experience design. Everything between them will be commodified.</span></p>

The future of work is about more than just automation. Machines push us to specialize in our competitive advantages, which would ideally&nbsp;push us toward a more connected and equitable economy.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p>What keeps you up at night?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>For many people worldwide, the answer is unemployment. Work is not just what allows us to sustain ourselves and our families: it expands our possibilities to be and do what we aspire to; it gives meaning and rhythm to our endeavors as part of a broader social contract. This is why in times of &ldquo;polycrisis&rdquo; and broader economic transformations, we dread losing what we hold so dear to a presumed automation apocalypse.</p>
<div><img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/03100000/v0p5ie0mRwtc3uv5gxjV8AtCcGFMBDbBj1934S4pyIQ-1024x428.png" alt="What are people most worried about?

Note: Representative sample of adults aged 16-64. September 2016: 18,014; August 2016: 18,042.</p></div>
<div>
<p>It is true: <a href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/the-risk-of-automation-for-jobs-in-oecd-countries_5jlz9h56dvq7-en?crawler=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">if a routine task can be performed cheaper, faster and better by a robot, there is a chance it will be</a>. What is also true &ndash; and even more certain &ndash; is that machines push us to specialize in our competitive advantages: more &ldquo;human&rdquo; work, creative and social intelligence, interpersonal and non-routine tasks are what makes us resilient and adaptive to change.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The future of work is about much more than automation. It is about equitable access to opportunities and accessibility. It is as much about finding employment as being entrepreneurial.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The future of work is about new ways to better preserve, share, spread and generate economic and social value. Advances in knowledge and technology have already empowered us with novel skills and solutions. They come down to three &ldquo;Cs&rdquo;: circular, collaborative and connective.</p>
</div>
<p><b>A Look into the Future of Work</b></p>
<div>
<p>In the 21st century, progress is about circling the economic and social square. As we reach planetary boundaries and unemployment tops our hierarchy of concerns, we can no longer afford to waste our capital &ndash; whether natural or human. A circular economy can help put an end to that.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Investing to make buildings more sustainable, for example, means more energy-efficient houses that curb pollution and help families save more on their energy bill. At the same time, making apartments smarter brings construction workers &ndash; who were hard hit by the 2008 financial crisis &ndash; back into the labor market, and equips them with new technical skills.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In the same way, projects like <a href="https://thelastmile.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Last Mile Works</a> turn inmates &ndash; who are generally considered economically passive members of society &ndash; into digital entrepreneurs, making them economically active while they are incarcerated and preparing them for reintegration when they are out.</p>
<div><img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/03100000/NyJuOdSSPjhxBraTkwJU7GWAntFrNKB3w3ll-Wz-HZA.png" alt="Trends in Routine and Non-Routine Tasks in Occupations, United States Image: OECD Skills Outlook 2013, OECD." width="617" height="485"><p>Trends in Routine and Non-Routine Tasks in Occupations, United States. Image: OECD Skills Outlook 2013, OECD.</p></div>
<div>
<p>Preserving and uncovering value is not enough. It must be shared and accessible. This is ever more possible in an increasingly collaborative economy. Communities in Brooklyn, New York are creating a <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/07/04/482958497/how-blockchain-helps-brooklyn-dwellers-use-neighbors-solar-energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared economy for peer-to-peer energy exchange</a> to be more resilient and take neighbors out of energy poverty. So if a house&rsquo;s solar panels produce excess electricity that would generally go to waste, that surplus can be transferred to another, immediately and at a locally determined price. Similarly, as <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/epsc/publications/strategic-notes/towards-low-emission-mobility_en#footnote6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cars are on average parked 92 percent of the time</a>, why not share them with those who face obstacles to mobility and maximize everyone&rsquo;s benefits?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Finally, circular and collaborative innovations would not run as efficiently &ndash; if at all &ndash; had we not entered the connective economy. Thanks to connectivity, drones can be activated with one click to deliver medicines to rural areas, saving lives that an ambulance would have never reached. The most expensive part of that drone &ndash; which can be built <a href="http://m.crn.com/news/mobility/video/300082469/watch-a-drone-expert-and-hps-cto-build-a-drone-in-under-15-minutes.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in 15 minutes</a> &ndash; was probably the result of a worldwide hackathon that made it openly accessible and brought its cost down to $8. Connectivity has extended our imagination, allowing us to engineer solutions to seemingly unsolvable problems, and invent new professions that not long ago only belonged to science fiction.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Connectivity also means that we can invite more talent &ndash; all talent &ndash; into the future workplace. Initiatives like <a href="http://stevensinitiative.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stevens</a> use virtual exchanges to build cross-cultural skills and facilitate the integration of today&rsquo;s immigrant children into tomorrow&rsquo;s ever more diverse workforce. The elderly and people with disabilities can overcome physical limits and enter digital workplaces. Women can tear down the last barriers of gender discrimination.</p>
<div><img src="http://dsg.files.app.content.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/gereports/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/03100000/oDl8KTWIY7TV9mrwOqQsxzNX6YAkZtVtGFH-unhOMCU-1024x566.png" alt="Image: European Commission. " width="1024" height="566"><p>Image: European Commission.</p></div>
<p>When we look at the future of work with circular, collaborative and connective lenses, it stops looking like the automation apocalypse. These &ldquo;three Cs&rdquo; are not just attributes of an economy that may well yield minimum waste and maximum benefits for a larger number of people. They are qualities of a networked society in which we become individually stronger when we act collectively. They are critical skills that allow us to turn specific problems into systemic possibilities, and shape the future of work we want. They are the demonstration that, in the 21st century, solidarity is not just an ethical quality, but it makes social and economic sense. A robot cannot see and seize that.</p>

<p>Shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/776vxq/status_of_openage_open_source_engine_clone_of/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> was this video showing off some of the progress:</p>

<div></div>

<p>Looks like it's really starting to come together, which is awesome. As someone who spent hours playing AoE, this project is really exciting to me. Who knows, in another year perhaps this might be quite playable? Looks a bit rough right now of course, but very interesting to see the state of it right now.</p>

<p>Much like OpenMW (Morrowind), OpenRA (Red Alert, Command &amp; Conquer, Dune 2000) and others, it aims to be an engine reimplementation that requires the original game assets. According to a comment from a developer, they're targetting Age of Empires II first, with Age of Empires and Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds to follow.</p>]]></content>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After decades of research and billions spent in clinical trials, we still have a problem with cancer drug delivery, says biomedical engineer Elizabeth Wayne. Chemotherapy kills cancer -- but it kills the rest of your body, too. Instead of using human design to fight cancer, why not use nature's? In this quick talk, Wayne explains how her lab is creating nanoparticle treatments that bind to immune cells, your body's first responders, to precisely target cancer cells without damaging healthy ones.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TEDTalks_video/~4/GNpUOtjnbqQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""></p>]]></content>

<p>Several months after Feynman&rsquo;s death, while working on what would become <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Genius-Life-Science-Richard-Feynman/dp/0679747044/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/genius-the-life-and-science-of-richard-feynman/oclc/25316182&amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>public library</em></a>) &mdash; the masterly biography plumbing <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/11/richard-feynman-genius-james-gleick/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the wellspring of Feynman&rsquo;s genius</a> &mdash; James Gleick discovered something of arresting strangeness and splendor. </p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart stopped,&rdquo; Gleick tells me. &ldquo;I have never had an experience like that as a biographer, before or since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a mass of unread papers sent to him by Feynman&rsquo;s widow, Gweneth, Gleick found a letter that discomposed his most central understanding of Feynman&rsquo;s character. A generation after computing pioneer Alan Turing <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/02/17/alan-turing-morcom-letters/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tussled with the binary code of body and spirit in the wake of loss</a>, Feynman &mdash; a scientist perhaps <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/01/01/ode-to-a-flower-richard-feynman/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">uncommonly romantic</a> yet resolutely rational and unsentimental in his reverence for the indomitable laws of physics that tend toward decay &mdash; penned a remarkable letter to a physical nonentity that was, for the future Nobel-winning physicist, the locus of an irrepressible metaphysical reality. </p>

<p>In high school, the teenage Richard spent summers at the beach in his native Far Rockaway. There, he grew besotted with a striking girl named Arline &mdash; a girl he knew he would marry. Both complement and counterpoint to his own nature, Arline met Richard&rsquo;s inclination for science with ardor for philosophy and art. (The art class he took just to be near her would lay the foundation for his <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/01/17/richard-feynman-ofey-sketches-drawings/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">little-known, lifelong passion for drawing</a>.) By his junior year, Richard proposed. Arline accepted. With the eyes of young love, they peered into a shared future of infinite possibility for bliss. </p>

<p>But they were abruptly grounded when a mysterious malady began afflicting Arline with inexplicable symptoms &mdash; a lump would appear and disappear on her neck, fevers would roil over her with no apparent cause. Eventually, she was hospitalized for what was believed to be typhoid. </p>
<p>Gleick writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Feynman began to glimpse the special powerlessness that medical uncertainty can inflict on a scientific person. He had come to believe that the scientific way of thinking brought a measure of calmness and control in difficult situations &mdash; but not now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just as Feynman began bombarding the doctors with questions that steered them toward a closer approximation of the scientific method, Arline began to recover just as mysteriously and unpredictably as she had fallen ill. But the respite was only temporary. The symptoms returned, still shorn of a concrete explanation but now unambiguously pointing toward the terminal &mdash; a prognosis Arline&rsquo;s doctors kept from her. Richard refused to go along with the deception &mdash; he and Arline had promised each other to face life with unremitting truthfulness &mdash; but he was forced to calibrate his commitment to circumstance. </p>
<p>Gleick writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>His parents, Arline&rsquo;s parents, and the doctors all urged him not to be so cruel as to tell a young woman she was dying. His sister, Joan, sobbing, told him he was stubborn and heartless. He broke down and bowed to tradition. In her room at Farmingdale Hospital, with her parents at her side, he confirmed that she had glandular fever. Meanwhile, he started carrying around a letter &mdash; a &ldquo;goodbye love letter,&rdquo; as he called it&mdash;that he planned to give her when she discovered the truth. He was sure she would never forgive the unforgivable lie. </p>
<p>He did not have long to wait. Soon after Arline returned home from the hospital she crept to the top of the stairs and overheard her mother weeping with a neighbor down in the kitchen. When she confronted Richard &mdash; his letter snug in his pocket &mdash; he told her the truth, handed her the letter, and asked her to marry him.</p></blockquote>

<p>Marriage, however, proved to be a towering practical problem &mdash; Princeton, where Feynman was now pursuing a Ph.D., threatened to withdraw the fellowships funding his graduate studies if he were to wed, for the university considered the emotional and pragmatic responsibilities of marriage a grave threat to academic discipline. </p>
<p>Just as Feynman began considering leaving Princeton, a diagnosis detonated the situation &mdash; Arline had contracted a rare form of tuberculosis, most likely from unpasteurized milk. </p>
<p>At first, Feynman was relieved that the grim alternative options of Hodgkin&rsquo;s disease and incurable cancers like lymphoma had been ruled out. But he was underestimating, or perhaps misunderstanding, the gravity of tuberculosis &mdash; the very disease which had <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/02/17/alan-turing-morcom-letters/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">taken the love of Alan Turing&rsquo;s life</a> and which, during its two-century heyday, had claimed more lives around the globe than any other malady and all wars combined. At the time of Arline&rsquo;s diagnosis in 1941, immunology was in its infancy, the antibiotic treatment of bacterial infections practically nonexistent, and the first successful medical application of penicillin a year away. Tuberculosis was a death sentence, even if it was a slow death with intervals of remission &mdash; a fact Richard and Arline faced with an ambivalent mix of brave lucidity and hope against hope. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Richard&rsquo;s parents met the prospect of his marriage with bristling dread. His mother, who believed he was marrying Arline out of pity rather than love, admonished him that he would be putting his health and his very life in danger, and coldly worried about how the stigma attached to tuberculosis would impact her brilliant young son&rsquo;s reputation. &ldquo;I was surprised to learn such a marriage is not unlawful,&rdquo; she scoffed unfeelingly. &ldquo;It ought to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Richard was buoyed by love &mdash; a love so large and luminous that he found himself singing aloud one day as he was arranging Arline&rsquo;s transfer to a sanatorium. Determined to go through with the wedding, he wrote to his beloved:</p>
<blockquote><p>I guess maybe it is like rolling off of a log &mdash; my heart is filled again &amp; I&rsquo;m choked with emotions &mdash; and love is so good &amp; powerful &mdash; it&rsquo;s worth preserving &mdash; I know nothing can separate us &mdash; we&rsquo;ve stood the tests of time and our love is as glorious now as the day it was born &mdash; dearest riches have never made people great but love does it every day &mdash; we&rsquo;re not little people &mdash; we&rsquo;re giants &hellip; I know we both have a future ahead of us &mdash; with a world of happiness &mdash; now &amp; forever.</p></blockquote>
<p>On June 29, 1942, they promised each other eternity. </p>

<p>Gleick writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>He borrowed a station wagon from a Princeton friend, outfitted it with mattresses for the journey, and picked up Arline in Cedarhurst. She walked down her father&rsquo;s hand-poured concrete driveway wearing a white dress. They crossed New York Harbor on the Staten Island ferry &mdash; their honeymoon ship. They married in a city office on Staten Island, in the presence of neither family nor friends, their only witnesses two strangers called in from the next room. Fearful of contagion, Richard did not kiss her on the lips. After the ceremony he helped her slowly down the stairs, and onward they drove to Arline&rsquo;s new home, a charity hospital in Browns Mills, New Jersey.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, WWII was reaching its crescendo of destruction, dragging America into the belly of death with the attack on Pearl Harbor. Now one of the nation&rsquo;s most promising physicists, Feynman was recruited to work on what would become <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/10/14/richard-feynman-graphic-novel-biography-ottoviani/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Manhattan Project</a> and soon joined the secret laboratory in Los Alamos. </p>

<p>Arline entered the nearby Albuquerque sanatorium, from where she wrote him letters in code &mdash; for the sheer fun of it, because she knew how he cherished puzzles, but the correspondence alarmed the military censors at the laboratory&rsquo;s Intelligence Office. Tasked with abating any breaches to the secrecy of the operation, they cautioned Feynman that coded messages were against the rules and demanded that his wife include a key in each letter to help them decipher it. This only amplified Arline&rsquo;s sense of fun &mdash; she began cutting holes into her letters, covering passages with ink, and even mail-ordered a jigsaw puzzle kit with which to cut up the pages and completely confound the agents. </p>
<p>But the levity masked the underlying darkness which Richard and Arline tried so desperately to evade &mdash; Arline was dying. As her body failed, he steadied himself to her spirit:</p>
<blockquote><p>You are a strong and beautiful woman. You are not always as strong as other times but it rises &amp; falls like the flow of a mountain stream. I feel I am a reservoir for your strength &mdash; without you I would be empty and weak&hellip; I find it much harder these days to write these things to you.</p></blockquote>
<p>In every single letter, he told her that he loved her. <em>&ldquo;I have a serious affliction: loving you forever,&rdquo;</em> he wrote. </p>

<p>In early 1945, two and a half years into their marriage, Richard and Arline made love for the first time. He had been too afraid of harming her frail health somehow, she too afraid of infecting him with the deadly bacterium consuming her. But Arline insisted that this pent up desire could no longer be contained and assured Richard that this would only bring them closer &mdash; to each other, and to the life they had so lovingly dreamt up for themselves:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ll always be your sweetheart &amp; first love &mdash; besides a devoted wife &mdash; we&rsquo;ll be proud parents too&hellip; I am proud of you always Richard &ndash;[you are] a good husband, and lover, &amp; well, coach, I&rsquo;ll show you what I mean Sunday.</p></blockquote>
<p>But heightened as their hopes were by this new dimension of shared experience, Arline&rsquo;s health continued to plummet. Her weight dropped to eighty-four pounds. Exasperated by the helplessness of medicine, which Feynman had come to see not as a manifestation but as a mutilation of the scientific method, he invested all hope in an experimental drug made of mold growths. &ldquo;Keep hanging on,&rdquo; he exhorted Arline. &ldquo;Nothing is certain. We lead a charmed life.&rdquo; She began spitting blood. </p>
<p>At twenty-seven, on the precipice of a brilliant scientific career, he was terminally in love. </p>
<p>On June 16, 1945, while working at the computing room at Los Alamos, Feynman received a call from the sanatorium that Arline was dying. He borrowed a colleague&rsquo;s car and sped to the hospital, where he found her immobile, her eyes barely tracing his movement. Early in his scientific career, he had been animated by the nature of time. Now, hours stretched and contracted as he sat at her deathbed, until one last small breath tolled the end at 9:21PM.</p>
<p>The wake of loss has a way of tranquilizing grief with the pressing demands of practical arrangements &mdash; a tranquilizer we take willingly, almost gratefully. The following morning, Feynman arranged for his beloved&rsquo;s cremation, methodically collected her personal belongings, and on the final page of the small spiral notebook in which she recorded her symptoms he wrote with scientific remove: &ldquo;June 16 &mdash; Death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so we arrive at Gleick&rsquo;s improbable discovery in that box of letters &mdash; improbable because of the extreme rationality with which Feynman hedged against even the slightest intimation of metaphysical conjectures untestable by science and unprovable by reason. During his courtship of Arline, he had been vexed by her enthusiasm for Descartes, whose &ldquo;proof&rdquo; of God&rsquo;s perfection he found intellectually lazy and unbefitting of Descartes&rsquo;s reputation as <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/03/31/descartes-rules-for-the-direction-of-the-mind/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a champion of reason</a>. He had impishly countered Arline&rsquo;s insistence that there are two sides to everything by cutting a piece of paper and half-twisting it into a M&ouml;bius strip, the ends pasted together to render a surface with just one side. </p>
<p>Everything that appeared mystical, Feynman believed, was simply an insufficiently explained mystery with a physical answer not yet found. Even Arline&rsquo;s dying hour had offered testing ground for conviction. Puzzlingly, the clock in the room had stopped at exactly 9:21PM &mdash; the time of death. Aware of how this bizarre occurrence could foment the mystical imagination in unscientific minds, Feynman reasoned for an explanation. Remembering that he had repaired the clock multiple times over the course of Arline&rsquo;s stay at the sanatorium, he realized that the instrument&rsquo;s unwieldy mechanism must have choked when the nurse picked it up in the low evening light to see and record the time. </p>
<p>How astonishing and how touchingly human, then, that Feynman penned the letter Gleick found in the box forty-two years later &mdash; a letter he wrote to Arline in October of 1946, 488 days after her death:</p>
<blockquote><p>D&rsquo;Arline,</p>
<p>I adore you, sweetheart.</p>
<p>I know how much you like to hear that &mdash; but I don&rsquo;t only write it because you like it &mdash; I write it because it makes me warm all over inside to write it to you.</p>
<p>It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote to you &mdash; almost two years but I know you&rsquo;ll excuse me because you understand how I am, stubborn and realistic; and I thought there was no sense to writing.</p>
<p>But now I know my darling wife that it is right to do what I have delayed in doing, and that I have done so much in the past. I want to tell you I love you. I want to love you. I always will love you.</p>
<p>I find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you after you are dead &mdash; but I still want to comfort and take care of you &mdash; and I want you to love me and care for me. I want to have problems to discuss with you &mdash; I want to do little projects with you. I never thought until just now that we can do that. What should we do. We started to learn to make clothes together &mdash; or learn Chinese &mdash; or getting a movie projector. Can&rsquo;t I do something now? No. I am alone without you and you were the &ldquo;idea-woman&rdquo; and general instigator of all our wild adventures.</p>
<p>When you were sick you worried because you could not give me something that you wanted to and thought I needed. You needn&rsquo;t have worried. Just as I told you then there was no real need because I loved you in so many ways so much. And now it is clearly even more true &mdash; you can give me nothing now yet I love you so that you stand in my way of loving anyone else &mdash; but I want you to stand there. You, dead, are so much better than anyone else alive.</p>
<p>I know you will assure me that I am foolish and that you want me to have full happiness and don&rsquo;t want to be in my way. I&rsquo;ll bet you are surprised that I don&rsquo;t even have a girlfriend (except you, sweetheart) after two years. But you can&rsquo;t help it, darling, nor can I &mdash; I don&rsquo;t understand it, for I have met many girls and very nice ones and I don&rsquo;t want to remain alone &mdash; but in two or three meetings they all seem ashes. You only are left to me. You are real.</p>
<p>My darling wife, I do adore you.</p>
<p>I love my wife. My wife is dead.</p>
<p>Rich.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then, with the sole defibrillator for heartache we have &mdash; humor &mdash; Feynman adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>PS Please excuse my not mailing this &mdash; but I don&rsquo;t know your new address.</p></blockquote>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p>Most modern Linux distributions enjoy standard repositories that include most of the software you&rsquo;ll need to successfully run your Linux server or desktop. Should a package come up missing, more than likely you&rsquo;ll find a repository you can add, so that the installation can be managed with the built-in package manager. This should be considered a best practice. Why? Because it&rsquo;s important for the integrity of the platform to ensure the package manager is aware of installed software. When that is the case, packages can easily be updated (to fix vulnerabilities and the like).</p></div></div></div>]]></content>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sound wave enables the sensation of hearing, and is an important way of communicating in the animal world. In physics, sound is considered as a mechanical vibration that can propagate in gases, liquids and solids. A research team from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), led by Assistant Professor Dr Ye Ai, is studying the interactions between ultrasound (beyond the audible limit of human hearing) and micron-sized objects (e.g. biological cells) suspended in aqueous solutions. Dr Ai's research team recently developed a highly accurate single cell level sorting technology using a highly focused sound wave beam (50 &mu;m wide roughly &frac14; of a single human hair's diameter). This new cell manipulation technology enables highly accurate isolation of rare cell populations in complex biological samples. More concisely, it provides the potential of finding a single cell in a million.</p>]]></content>

These historic observations suggest that this unique object is the result of the merger of two neutron stars. The cataclysmic aftermaths of this kind of merger -- long-predicted events called kilonovae -- disperse heavy elements such as gold and platinum throughout the Universe. This discovery also provides the strongest evidence yet that short-duration gamma-ray bursts are caused by mergers of neutron stars.</p>]]></content>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hurricanes, traffic jams, demographic development &ndash; to predict the effect of such events, computer simulations are required. Many processes in nature, however, are so complicated that conventional computers fail. Quantum simulators may solve this problem. One of the basic phenomena in nature is the interaction between light and matter in photosynthesis. Physicists of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) have now made a big step towards quantum mechanics understanding of plant metabolism.
