TMSR changes the way the brain processes motor control and somatosensory input. A patient fitted with a TMSR prosthetic “sends” motor commands to the reinnervated muscles, where his or her movement intentions are decoded and sent to the prosthetic limb while direct stimulation of the skin over the re-innervated muscles is sent back to the brain, inducing touch perception on the missing limb.

  <p>(Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) EPFL scientists from the Center for Neuroprosthetics have used functional MRI to show how the brain re-maps motor and sensory pathways following targeted motor and sensory reinnervation (TMSR), a neuroprosthetic approach where residual limb nerves are rerouted towards intact muscles and skin regions to control a robotic limb….</p>
