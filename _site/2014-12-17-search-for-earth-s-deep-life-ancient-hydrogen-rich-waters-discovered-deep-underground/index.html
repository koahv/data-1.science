 A team of scientists has mapped the location of hydrogen-rich waters found trapped kilometres beneath Earth’s surface in rock fractures in Precambrian rocks make up over 70% of the surface of the Earth’s crust in Canada, South Africa and Scandinavia.
 The team says their findings provide a “global network of sites” with hydrogen-rich waters that can be targeted in the search for deep life over coming years. They also point to the implications for life on Mars. The Red Planet has ancient rocks with hydrogen-producing potential, so could also host microbial life: “If the ancient rocks of Earth are producing this much hydrogen, it may be that similar processes are taking place on Mars,” Sherwood Lollar, a geoscientist at University of T…</p>
