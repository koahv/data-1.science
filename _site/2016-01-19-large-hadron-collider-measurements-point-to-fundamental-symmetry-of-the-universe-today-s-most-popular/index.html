 This past August, scientists working with CERN’s ALICE (a Large Ion Collider Experiment), a heavy-ion detector on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) ring, made precise measurements of particle mass and electric charge that confirm the existence of a fundamental symmetry in nature. “After the Big Bang, for every particle of matter an antiparticle was created. In particle physics, a very important question is whether all the laws of physics display a specific kind of symmetry known as CPT, and these measurements suggest that there is indeed a fundamental symmetry between nuclei and antinuclei,” said Marcelo Gameiro Munhoz, a professor at the University of São Paulo (USP).</p>
