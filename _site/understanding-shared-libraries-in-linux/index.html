  <p>In programming, a library is an assortment of pre-compiled pieces of code that can be reused in a program. Libraries simplify life for programmers, in that they provide reusable functions, routines, classes, data structures and so on (written by a another programmer), which they can use in their programs. Linux supports two classes of libraries, namely: Static libraries – are bound to a program statically at compile time; Dynamic or shared libraries – are loaded when a program is launched and loaded into memory and binding occurs at run time. Dynamic or shared libraries can further be categorized into: Dynamically linked libraries – here a program is linked with the shared library and the kernel loads the library (in case it’s not in memory) upon execution; Dynamically loaded libraries – the program takes full control by calling functions with the library. Shared libraries are named in two ways: the library name (a.k.a soname) and a “filename” (absolute path to file which stores library code). For example, the soname for libc is libc.so.6: where lib is the prefix, c is a descriptive name, so means shared object, and 6 is the version. And its filename is: /lib64/libc.so.6. Note that the soname is actually a symbolic link to the filename.</p>
