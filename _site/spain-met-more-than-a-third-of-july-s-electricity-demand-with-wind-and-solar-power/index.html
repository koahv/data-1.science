<meta name="description" content="Extract July was a banner month in Spain in terms of renewable energy production with 34 percent of the country’s energy needs being met by wind and solar energy. Wind was the prominent low-carbon energy source in the Iberian Peninsula, providing 30 percent of the country’s energy needs, while solar power supplied about 4 percent. July’s renewable energy output is particularly noteworthy considering that the total combined energy provided by wind and solar in the entire first six months of 2014 only reached approximately 25.3 percent." />
