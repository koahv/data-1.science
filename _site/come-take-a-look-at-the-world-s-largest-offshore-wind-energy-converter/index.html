The company says the gargantuan converter station has a 916MW power transmission capacity, making it the world’s most powerful installation of its kind, producing enough energy to power more than 1m households with clean energy. Measuring 100m tall and long by 70m in width, the station is part of the DolWin2 project and will connect offshore wind farms in the North Sea’s DolWin cluster, currently the largest offshore wind farm cluster worldwide, with the German power grid." />
