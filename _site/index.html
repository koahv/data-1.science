>In programming, a library is an assortment of pre-compiled pieces of code that can be reused in a program. Libraries simplify life for programmers, in that they provide reusable functions, routines, classes, data structures and so on (written by a another programmer), which they can use in their programs. For instance, if you are building an application that needs to perform math operations, you don’t have to create a new math function for that, you can simply use existing functions in libraries for that programming language. Examples of libraries in Linux include libc (the standard C library) or glibc (GNU version of the standard C library), libcurl (multiprotocol file transfer library), libcrypt (library used for encryption, hashing, and encoding in C) and many more.

>In programming, a library is an assortment of pre-compiled pieces of code that can be reused in a program. Libraries simplify life for programmers, in that they provide reusable functions, routines, classes, data structures and so on (written by a another programmer), which they can use in their programs. Linux supports two classes of libraries, namely: Static libraries – are bound to a program statically at compile time; Dynamic or shared libraries – are loaded when a program is launched and loaded into memory and binding occurs at run time. Dynamic or shared libraries can further be categorized into: Dynamically linked libraries – here a program is linked with the shared library and the kernel loads the library (in case it’s not in memory) upon execution; Dynamically loaded libraries – the program takes full control by calling functions with the library. Shared libraries are named in two ways: the library name (a.k.a soname) and a “filename” (absolute path to file which stores library code). For example, the soname for libc is libc.so.6: where lib is the prefix, c is a descriptive name, so means shared object, and 6 is the version. And its filename is: /lib64/libc.so.6. Note that the soname is actually a symbolic link to the filename.

This group includes many talented individuals who can bring unique and valuable experiences and insights to projects and workplaces. Open source communities are particularly well-positioned for workforce inclusion, because technology can help level the playing field for people with disabilities.

>There can be many reasons for a project fork. Perhaps the project has lain fallow for a while and someone wants to revive it. Perhaps the company that has underwritten the project has been acquired and the community is afraid that the new parent company may close the project. Or perhaps there's a schism within the community itself, where a portion of the community has decided to go a different direction with the project.

#### Factsheet
>To "fork" means to take a copy of the project, rename it, and start a new project and community around the copy. If you wish to contribute to a project that uses git as its version control system, you'll need to create a clone of it. This will create a local clone of the repository, against which you can make whatever changes you like. If you wish to contribute the changes back to the original repository, you must send a pull request. Unless the maintainers of the original repository grant you access to it directly, you cannot contribute to that repository without both a clone of it and a pull request against it. Clones, unlike forks, are technical actions and do not need to involve the community or any social changes.

>Threat modeling can be usefully done with a pen, whiteboard and one or more security-aware people who understand how their application is built, and this is MUCH better than not threat modeling at all. However, to do it effectively with multiple people and multiple project iterations you need a tool. Commercial tools are available, and Microsoft provides a free tool for Windows only, but established, free, open-source, cross-platform tools are non-existent. OWASP Threat Dragon aims to fill this gap.

>A guest blog post by Mike Goodwin. What is threat modeling? Application threat modeling is a structured approach to identifying ways that an adversary might try to attack an application and then designing mitigations to prevent, detect or reduce the impact of those attacks. The description of an application’s threat model is identified as one of the criteria for the Linux CII Best Practises Silver badge. Why threat modeling? It is well established that defense-in-depth is a key principle for network security and the same is true for application security. But although most application developers will intuitively understand this as a concept, it can be hard to put it into practice. After many years and sleepless nights, worrying and fretting...

#### Factsheet
>Application threat modeling is a structured approach to identifying ways that an adversary might try to attack an application and then designing mitigations to prevent, detect or reduce the impact of those attacks. Threat modeling is an exceptionally powerful technique for building defense-in-depth into an application design. It is also great for identifying security flaws at design time where they are cheap and easy to correct. These kinds of flaws are often subtle and hard to detect by traditional testing approaches.

"Open source" focuses on the practical consequences enabled by these licenses: surprisingly effective collaboration on software development.

>"In this research, we determined how cells detect the position of molecules (or ligands) in their surroundings with nanometre precision," says Roca-Cusachs. Researchers proved that by altering the conditions of the cell's environment (rigidity and distribution of those ligands that create the extracellular matrix), they can control the adherence response of the cell, and even define a range in which the cell adheres. Researchers can measure how cells regulate force distribution and the number of ligands to which they adhere regarding their density.

#### Extract
>The process through which cells are able to sense their environment is regulated by force detection. This is the main conclusion of a study published in the journal Nature, led by the team of Pere Roca-Cusachs, lecturer from the Department of Biomedicine and main researcher at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC)....

#### Factsheet
>The process through which cells are able to sense their environment is regulated by force detection. Interaction between cells and their ligands (the cell microenvironment) is essential to maintaining tissue function, and the detection of changes in the cell environment is essential in all situations where there is tissue remodelling, such as embryonic development, tumoral proliferation or the healing of a wound. "Depending on this cell force distribution, it can affect the activation of genetic transcription, a phenomenon that determines which genes are expressed," says Roger Oria.

#### Factsheet
>Plants thrive in drylands by keeping their stomata, or pores, shut during the day to conserve water and open at night to collect carbon dioxide. This form of photosynthesis is known as crassulacean acid metabolism or CAM. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, or PEPC is an important "worker" enzyme responsible for the nighttime fixation of carbon dioxide into malic acid. Malic acid is then converted back to carbon dioxide for photosynthesis during the day. Crop production is the world's largest consumer of freshwater. Availability of clean water resources is shrinking because of urbanization, human population growth and changes in climate, which presents a challenge to optimal growing environments. Engineering CAM photosynthesis into food and energy crops could reduce agricultural water use and boost crops' resilience

#### Extract
>(Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg) Global warming affects more than just plant biodiversity -- it even alters the way plants grow. A team of researchers at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) joined forces with the Leibniz Institute for Plant Biochemistry (IPB) to discover which molecular processes are involved in plant growth. In the current edition of the internationally renowned journal "Current Biology", the group presents its latest findings on the mechanism controlling growth at high temperatures....

#### Factsheet
>Plants react much more sensitively to fluctuations in temperature than animals. They are also unable to seek out warmer or cooler locations. "When temperatures rise, plants grow taller in order to cool themselves off. Their stalks become taller and their leaves become narrower and grow farther apart. Yet this makes the plant more unstable overall." Earlier studies have shown that the protein PIF4 directly controls plant growth and that this protein is also dependent on temperature. When it's cold, PIF4 is less active - in other words the plant doesn't grow. At higher temperatures, PIF4 activates growth-promoting genes and the plant grows taller.

In order to find this out, the 'Jena Experiment' was established in 2002, one of the largest biodiversity experiments worldwide. Professor Wolfgang Weisser from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) reports on two unexpected findings of the long-term study: Biodiversity influences almost half the processes in the ecosystem, and intensive grassland management does not result in higher yields than high biodiversity....

#### Factsheet
>Biodiversity influences almost half the processes in the ecosystem, and intensive grassland management does not result in higher yields than high biodiversity. An ecosystem provides humans with natural "services", such as the fertility of the soil, the quality of the groundwater, the production of food, and pollination by insects, which is essential for many fruits. Hence, intact ecosystems are crucial for the survival of all living things. The Jena Experiment proves for the very first time that a loss of biodiversity results in negative consequences for many individual components and processes in ecosystems.

#### Factsheet
>International trade of wild birds is a root cause of exotic birds spreading worldwide. Birds are the most traded animals in the world. When wild birds are exported to another country it can lead to biodiversity loss, damage of local ecosystems, crop destroyal, and outcompetion of local birds. Before 2005, a bird group known as passerines constituted almost 80% of all traded birds; today passerine birds constitute less than 20% of trade while parrots have risen to almost 80%. Parrots are a threatened group of bird species and they are most likely to establish in countries it not naturally occurs. Latin America has overtaken West Africa in wild bird exports with a 50% global exportation share worldwide (November 2017).

The researchers concluded that it remained unclear whether the increased oxygenation had a direct effect on animal life, or even if it had a passive effect by, say, expanding the oxygen-rich ecospace. So it is difficult to resolve if temperature, increased oxygenation or something else served as the driver for biodiversification.

An exciton is an energetic state of a molecule, or closely coupled group of molecules after they are excited by light absorption. Quantum coherence is light excitation that can be shared between molecules which can enhance energy transfer efficiency. Photosynthesis describes the process plants' use to convert energy from the sun and convert it into biological energy for growth. Virtually all life on earth relies directly or indirectly on photosynthesis. Organisms using photosynthesis are able to collect sunlight energy and transport it to reaction centers where the energy may be harnessed.

    #### Digest
>Using a molecular method likely to become widely adopted by the field, researchers supported by the National Institutes of Health have discovered brain circuitry essential for alertness, or vigilance - and for brain states more generally. Karl Deisseroth, M.D., Ph.D., Matthew Lovett-Barron, Ph.D., and Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, colleagues, report on findings using a neural activity screening technology they call Multi-MAP (Multiplexed-alignment of Molecular and Activity Phenotypes) online Nov. 2, 2017 in the journal Cell. A molecular analysis revealing subtypes led to identification of six suspect circuits composed of distinct populations of neurons that modulate neuronal activity.

#### Extract
>(NIH/National Institute of Mental Health) Using a molecular method likely to become widely adopted by the field, researchers have discovered brain circuitry essential for alertness, or vigilance -- and for brain states more generally. Strikingly, the same cell types and circuits are engaged during alertness in zebra fish and mice, species whose evolutionary forebears parted ways hundreds of millions of years ago. This suggests that the human brain is likely similarly wired for this state critical to survival....

#### Factsheet
>For the first time, Multi-MAP makes it possible to see which neurons are activated in a behaving animal during a particular brain state - and subsequently molecularly analyze just those neurons to identify the sub-types and circuits involved.

>X3 Hall-effect When it comes to the future of space exploration, a number of new technologies are being investigated. Foremost among these are new forms of propulsion that will be able to balance fuel-efficiency with power. Not only would engines that are capable of achieving a great deal of thrust using less fuel be cost-effective, they will be able to ferry astronauts to destinations like Mars and beyond in less time. This is where engines like the X3 Hall-effect thruster comes into play. This thruster, which is being developed by NASA’s Glenn Research Center in conjunction with the US Air Force and the University of Michigan, is a scaled-up model of the kinds of thrusters used by the Dawn spacecraft. During a recent test, this thruster s...

>Cells are constantly monitoring the environment around them and are programmed to respond to molecular cues in their surroundings in distinct ways – some cues may prompt cells to grow, some lead to cell movement and others initiate cell death. For a cell to remain healthy, these responses must be finely balanced. It took evolution over two billion years to tune these responses and orchestrate their interplay in each and every human cell. Cells are exposed to thousands of different signals – some they will have encountered before, while others that are entirely new. Receptors that sense these signals form one part of a complex modular architecture created by the assembly of building blocks like in a Lego design. It is the precise combination of these 'Lego bricks' and the way in which they are built that dictates how a cell responds to a given signal. The ability to edit the human genome has transformed the way scientists approach some of our biggest medical challenges.

>Within radiation belts, very energetic particles, such as electrons and protons, move around the planet at high velocities - captured by its magnetic field. In the case of the Earth, the solar wind, a current of charged particles from the Sun varying in strength, controls the intensity of the radiation belt both directly and indirectly. The radiation belts of Saturn, however, develop completely independently of the solar wind and are instead decisively influenced by the gas giant's moons. The activity of the Sun – and with it the strength of the solar wind – follows an eleven-year cycle. Saturn's proton radiation belts are gigantic: they reach from the planet's innermost ring to the orbit of the moon Tethys – and thus more than 285,000 kilometers into space. A decisive difference to Earth: while our moon is located far beyond the limits of the magnetosphere and the radiation belts, Saturn's radiation belts contain several of its satellites, such as the large moons Janus, Mimas, and Enceladus. On Earth, the high-energy particles that form the radiation belts have two origins. Some are provided directly by the solar wind. Others result from incident protons of extreme energy originating from our Galaxy, called Galactic Cosmic Rays. When Galactic Cosmic Rays reach the planet's atmosphere, it sets in motion a chain of reactions, at the end of which high-energy electrons and protons are created. Since the solar wind partially shields and thus modulates this cosmic radiation, the Sun's activity also plays a decisive role in this process.  "We observe that the intensity drop in the proton radiation belts of Saturn coincides exactly with strong changes in the EUV radiation from the Sun," Roussos describes. It is therefore possible that while the solar wind has no impact on the radiation belts, the Sun still may.
