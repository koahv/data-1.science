  &lt;p&gt;An international team made up of scientists from Brazil, Australia, the U.S., Ecuador, Germany and Sweden has published the results of an extensive database of snakes of the American tropics. This database is made up of museum collections from the past 150 years and demonstrates that some Neotropical regions, such as the Cerrado in the central Brazil, contain a disproportionately high diversity. Furthermore, some other diverse regions are disproportionately under-sampled, such as the Amazon. For the first time, distribution patterns, collection records and frequency of occurrence are recorded from a total of 147,515 contributions to 886 snake species. Thus, the database covers 74 percent of all snake species from 27 countries. The database will serve as a solid basis for conservation concepts, and biodiversity and evolution models in the future.

  &lt;p&gt;Bug researchers in Germany are puzzled.
New data suggests the total population of flying insects there has declined a whopping 75% in the past 27 years. And no one knows why.
A study released Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE details a longitudinal study by German researchers to measure “flying insect biomass” — the weight of all flying bugs — in 63 protected spots around the country.
The scientists surveyed places like dunes, grasslands, and forests, using trapping tents to collect over 118 pounds of bugs over the 27 year period. They were expecting to find some population decreases, but this extreme decline, they said, is “alarming”.
The most recent Living Planet Index (which measures biodiversity and population trends in fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals around the world) suggested that wildlife abundance on Earth decreased by as much as 58% between 1970 and 2012. Butterfly, bee, and moth populations have previously been shown to be in decline across Europe.
But this widespread insect death struck the researchers as extreme. At the peak of summer heat, when there are usually more bugs out than in the spring and fall, the drop was even more pronounced, and bug counts were down 82%, — that’s 7% more than the average decline over the 27-year period.
The lack of insects, of course, also problematic for small critters who eat flying bugs and has ripple effects up the food chain. A majority (roughly 80%) of plants rely on insects for pollination, and birds gobble them for sustenance.  German birds are feeling the squeeze on their food supply — new research published Thursday shows that Germany lost 15% of its non-endangered bird population in the past 12 years.
The researchers aren’t sure what’s causing this precipitous fall. Across the diverse swath of German habitats studied, all spots saw similar declines, suggesting the decrease had nothing to do with landscape changes. And the scientists don’t think shifts in weather, land use, or climate change are valid explanations either. If anything, rising global temperatures should increase bug populations, the authors argue, because insect biomass is “positively related” to temperature, according to their models.
Other experts have pointed out, however, that not all bugs thrive on a warming Earth. The Washington Post reports that an especially warm spring could bring some bugs (like bees) out early, only to starve when there’s not enough food.
But the German researchers are zeroing in on one possible explanation for their findings: “Pesticide usage, year-round tillage, increased use of fertilizers and frequency of agronomic measures… may form a plausible cause,” they wrote.
More research is needed to know the role the agricultural industry is playing, but the German Farmer’s Union is already playing defense. The association’s secretary general, Bernhard Krüsken, told Deutsche Welle that “considering that the insect count was done exclusively in protected habitats, this shows that it would be premature to quickly point at agriculture.”
Regardless of the cause, scientists worldwide have been sounding the alarm about declining insect populations for months.
“If you’re an insect-eating bird living in that area, four-fifths of your food is gone in the last quarter-century, which is staggering,” Dave Goulson, an ecologist at the University of Sussex, told Science Magazine earlier this year. “One almost hopes” the German trend is unique, he said, and not reverberating around the globe.

  &lt;p&gt;Cut and Paste
For the first time, doctors have edited the genome of a living human patient. A 44-year-old man received the treatment at a hospital in Oakland, California on November 13.
The patient suffers from Hunter syndrome, a rare genetic condition which leaves the sufferer without an enzyme that’s used to break down complex polysaccharides, a carbohydrate. Left untreated, it can cause permanent damage to mental development, organ function and physical abilities. In this case, doctors have attempted to correct the condition by using zinc finger nucleuses (ZFNs). These enzymes cut a gene that’s present in liver cells, inserting a functional copy of the gene that produces the desired enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The treatment was developed by Sangamo Therapeutics, a biotechnology firm based in California. “This is the first time someone could have a new gene put into their liver,” said the company’s president and CEO, Sandy Macrae, in an interview with The Scientist. He described performing the trial as “a privilege and a responsibility.”
ZFNs are a more unwieldy method of performing gene editing than CRISPR Cas-9, but they do offer more precision. The implementation utilized by Sangamo reportedly offers the ability to cut at any base that might be required.
Gene Genie
A successful trial like this demonstrates how far we’ve come in terms of being able to make edits to the human genome. Between CRISPR and ZFNs, we have developed powerful tools that allow us to make precise modifications – and that will allow us to treat a wide variety of different conditions.
This procedure is part of a larger trial being carried out by Sangamo, which will also consist of experimental treatments for people suffering from hemophilia B and Hurler syndrome, as well as Hunter syndrome. All three diseases are caused by absent or non-functional genes, which can now be inserted thanks to these cutting-edge techniques.
The use of ZFNs to treat Hunter syndrome offers up a huge improvement over the way the disease is addressed at present. The current method typically involves weekly infusions of enzyme replacement therapy. While this has proven to be effective, since the patient isn’t actually producing the enzymes, it’s an ongoing treatment that consumes a lot of time and money. Click to View Full Infographic
Conversely, ZFNs make lasting changes to the human body that remove the problem entirely. It’s easy to see how this technique could have a huge impact on the patient’s quality of life – it’s a matter of nipping the issue in the bud, rather than addressing it continually. The next step will be to figure out how this technique might be used to treat other conditions.

In this case, doctors have attempted to correct the condition by using zinc finger nucleuses (ZFNs). These enzymes cut a gene that’s present in liver cells, inserting a functional copy of the gene that produces the desired enzyme.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bioengineered robotic hand with its own nervous system will sense touch</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/technology/2017/11/14/bioengineered-robotic-hand-with-its-own-nervous-system-will-sense-touch.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bioengineered robotic hand with its own nervous system will sense touch" /><published>2017-11-14T05:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-11-14T05:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/technology/2017/11/14/bioengineered-robotic-hand-with-its-own-nervous-system-will-sense-touch</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/technology/2017/11/14/bioengineered-robotic-hand-with-its-own-nervous-system-will-sense-touch.html">&lt;h4 id=&quot;extract&quot;&gt;Extract&lt;/h4&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The green sulfur bacterium makes its home in the chilly waters of the Black Sea. To eke out its lonely existence, this life form scavenges energy from the feeble sunlight available to it at a depth of over 250 feet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Plants carry out photosynthesis by converting photons of light striking their chromophores into another form of energy known as an exciton. An exciton is an energetic state of a molecule, or closely coupled group of molecules after they are excited by light absorption. Quantum coherence is light excitation that can be shared between molecules which can enhance energy transfer efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
