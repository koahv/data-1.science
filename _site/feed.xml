  &lt;p&gt;AI holds real potential for improving both the speed and accuracy of medical diagnostics – but before clinicians can harness the power of AI to identify conditions in images such as X-rays, they have to ‘teach’ the algorithms what to look for. Now, engineers have designed a new approach: using machine learning to create computer generated X-rays to augment AI training sets. …&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;THE FAMILY BUSINESS. Phil and Anthony Butler aren’t just father and son. The physics professor and bioengineering professor (respectively) are also business partners. And this week, their company, MARS Bioimaging, unveiled a first-of-its-kind x-ray scanner 10 years in the making.
First, a quick recap of how x-ray imaging works. When x-rays travel through your body, they’re absorbed by denser materials (bones) and pass right through softer ones (muscles and other tissues). The x-rays that pass through unimpeded hit a film on the opposite side of your body. These show up as areas of solid black. The places where the x-rays couldn’t pass through appear solid white.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Higgs boson, discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012, has a singular role in the Standard Model of particle physics. Most notable is the Higgs boson’s affinity to mass, which can be likened to the electric charge for an electric field: the larger the mass of a fundamental particle, the larger the strength of its interaction, or “coupling,” with the Higgs boson. Deviations from these predictions could be a hallmark of new physics in this as-yet little-explored part of the Standard Model….&lt;/p&gt;
