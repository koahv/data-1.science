The calculations take into account how muons interact with all other known particles through three of nature’s four fundamental forces (the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, and electromagnetism) while reducing the greatest source of uncertainty in the prediction. The results, published in Physical Review Letters as an Editors’ Suggestion, come just in time for the start of a new experiment measuring the wobble now underway at DOE’s Fermi Nation…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Hold still while Vincent van Bot paints your portrait.
That’s right, sophisticated robots can now create works of art comparable to the old masters. The RobotArt gallery has amassed an impressive collection to show what the world’s most creative androids and algorithms (and their creators) have come up with. On Wednesday, the international contest, now in its third year, announced the top ten teams, all of which walk away with cash prizes for their creations. In addition, winning artworks from the past three years will go on display at the Seattle Art Fair on August 2-5.

  &lt;p&gt;The sun’s activity waxes and wanes periodically and holds sway over our space environment. Sunspots, strongly magnetized blotches on the solar surface, sometimes release fierce storms in space that severely impact our satellite based communication and navigational systems and occasionally, render satellites useless. However, a complete understanding of all aspects of the sunspot activity cycle remains elusive. One of its curious features is the long observed lopsided activity of its two hemispheres.

  &lt;p&gt;Deep learning is a broad field of research with the objective of creating artificial intelligence that is capable of instructing itself to perform tasks rather than relying on algorithms. In theory, this would allow AI to succeed at tasks that would be prohibitively difficult, resource-intensive, or time-consuming for a human developer to work on. However, deep learning requires dedicated experts to oversee and develop the AI — undermining some of the intent behind having AI that can self-teach. If you need an expert on hand regardless, why do you need an AI capable of deep learning? AWS and Microsoft seek to change that.
