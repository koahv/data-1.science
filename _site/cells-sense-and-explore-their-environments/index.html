<blockquote>
  <p>The process through which cells are able to sense their environment is regulated by force detection. This is the main conclusion of a study published in the journal Nature, led by the team of Pere Roca-Cusachs, lecturer from the Department of Biomedicine and main researcher at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC)….</p>

<h4 id="factsheet">Factsheet</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>The process through which cells are able to sense their environment is regulated by force detection. Interaction between cells and their ligands (the cell microenvironment) is essential to maintaining tissue function, and the detection of changes in the cell environment is essential in all situations where there is tissue remodelling, such as embryonic development, tumoral proliferation or the healing of a wound. “Depending on this cell force distribution, it can affect the activation of genetic transcription, a phenomenon that determines which genes are expressed,” says Roger Oria.</p>
