  <p>The Sun is our parent star (Image Credit: NASA SDO)
It’s a well-known fact that the light we see from stars has taken hundreds, even thousands, of years to reach us. The photons made in the centers of these distant stars have traveled across enormous expanses of space and time in order to enter our retinas. But what about the light made in our own Sun? What do those photons experience on their way to the Earth? 
Let’s chart the journey of a single photon:
First Stage: The Core</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our photon was produced in the core of the Sun: where the densities and temperatures—which can reach 15 million °C (27 million °F)—are high enough to sustain nuclear fusion. The hydrogen atoms that make up most of the Sun’s mass have too much energy to stay together, so they split into their component parts: protons and electrons—creating plasma. 
When two protons collide inside this high-energy plasma, they bond, ultimately creating a deuterium atom, as well as releasing a neutrino and a positron. If another proton collides with a deuterium atom, they form a helium-3 nucleus and release a gamma ray. This gamma ray is our photon, albeit an extremely energized one. After the photon is created, two helium-3 nuclei can combine to create a helium-4 nucleus, and two protons.
This process, which is called the proton-proton chain, is the backbone of nuclear fusion. But it doesn’t end there.
The neutrino, being a weakly-interacting particle, will fly off into space, while the positron will interact with an electron, annihilating both of them and creating another gamma ray. In a later stage of the Sun’s life-cycle, the helium atoms produced by the fusion reaction can themselves combine, in different reactions, to make heavier and heavier elements, releasing even more energy.
Next Stage: Radiative Zone</p>

<p>The radiative zone is just beyond the core of the Sun. It gets its name from its primary method of heat transfer: the radiation of light. As our photon leaves the core and enters the radiative zone, it encounters an obstacle: densely packed protons. They are so crammed together, photons can’t travel more than a few millimeters without hitting another one. Each time one does, it loses some of its energy and is scattered in a random direction. 
As a result, its forward progress is slowed to a crawl. It can take anywhere from a few thousand to a few million years for one photon to escape. It’s not just the light from distant stars that takes millions of years to reach us; the light from our own Sun does too!
Phase 3: The Convection Zone</p>

<p>The convection zone is the final interior layer of the Sun; It ends at the Sun’s surface. Here, heat transfer is dominated by convection: moving currents of plasma from bounce between the hot interior and cooler exterior. The Sun’s plasma behaves much like a boiling pot of water, with hot bubbles forming deep inside the Sun rising to the surface—creating granules and supergranules.

The density of the solar plasma is much less than in the radiative zone. At the surface, the density is ten thousand times less than the density of air, so our photon wouldn’t hit many atoms as it makes its way through. After bouncing around in the radiative zone, our photon has lost much of its energy, and has shifted into the visible spectrum. Millions of years after it was created in a fusion reaction, our photon finally breaks free from the Sun’s interior.
Emergence: Solar Atmosphere</p>

<p>Leaving the surface of the Sun, our photon then enters the Sun’s atmosphere, which (like Earth) has multiple layers.  Our photon passes through the thin photosphere first, before entering the thicker chromosphere. Something interesting happens at this point: the temperatures start to increase as the photon makes its way through the corona (the outermost layer of the Sun’s atmosphere). The corona—a white-hot plume of plasma that extends millions of kilometers away from the Sun—is hundreds of times hotter than the surface.
Although the corona is very sparsely populated with atoms, photons can still be scattered by dust or free electrons. However, they usually pass through mostly unimpeded, and head toward the direction of Earth. Many trillions of other photons join it, with trillions more travelling in other directions. Their combined energy can exert a force on any object large enough to get in the way. 
This force is called radiation pressure, and it could be used in the future to power solar sails.
Finally, Destination: Earth</p>

<p>It takes approximately 8 minutes for our photon to travel the 93,000,000 miles (150 million kilometers) from the Sun to Earth. Once there, it dodges space debris and satellites and enters the atmosphere. If our photon were a gamma ray, an x-ray, or an ultraviolet ray, it would be absorbed or reflected by the upper atmosphere, and it would never reach the ground. 
The Sun emits radiation almost all across the electromagnetic spectrum (Image of the Sun courtesy of NASA)
If it were a visible-light photon with a blue or violet wavelength, it would be scattered by the lower atmosphere, and reach the ground at more extreme angles. However, our photon has a red wavelength, and it passes straight through the atmosphere with minimal interaction. 
Near the surface, our photon makes contact with the lens of an eye, where it is focused on a small spot on the retina. There, it is finally absorbed by a protein inside a cone cell, which sends an electrical signal to the brain and marks the end of the million year journey of a photon.

The shimmering colors visible in this NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image show off the remarkable complexity of the Twin Jet Nebula. The new image highlights the nebula’s shells and its knots of expanding gas in striking detail. Two iridescent lobes of material stretch outwards from a central star system. Within these lobes two huge jets of gas are streaming from the star system at speeds in excess of one million kilometers per hour.
The cosmic butterfly pictured in this NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image goes by many names. It is called the Twin Jet Nebula as well as answering to the slightly less poetic name of PN M2-9.
The M in this name refers to Rudolph Minkowski, a German-American astronomer who discovered the nebula in 1947. The PN, meanwhile, refers to the fact that M2-9 is a planetary nebula. The glowing and expanding shells of gas clearly visible in this image represent the final stages of life for an old star of low to intermediate mass. The star has not only ejected its outer layers, but the exposed remnant core is now illuminating these layers – resulting in a spectacular light show like the one seen here. However, the Twin Jet Nebula is not just any planetary nebula, it is a bipolar nebula.
Ordinary planetary nebulae have one star at their center, bipolar nebulae have two, in a binary star system. Astronomers have found that the two stars in this pair each have around the same mass as the Sun, ranging from 0.6 to 1.0 solar masses for the smaller star, and from 1.0 to 1.4 solar masses for its larger companion. The larger star is approaching the end of its days and has already ejected its outer layers of gas into space, whereas its partner is further evolved, and is a small white dwarf
The characteristic shape of the wings of the Twin Jet Nebula is most likely caused by the motion of the two central stars around each other. It is believed that a white dwarf orbits its partner star and thus the ejected gas from the dying star is pulled into two lobes rather than expanding as a uniform sphere. However, astronomers are still debating whether all bipolar nebulae are created by binary stars. Meanwhile the nebula’s wings are still growing and, by measuring their expansion, astronomers have calculated that the nebula was created only 1200 years ago.
Within the wings, starting from the star system and extending horizontally outwards like veins are two faint blue patches. Although these may seem subtle in comparison to the nebula’s rainbow colors, these are actually violent twin jets streaming out into space, at speeds in excess of one million kilometers per hour. This is a phenomenon that is another consequence of the binary system at the heart of the nebula. These jets slowly change their orientation, precessing across the lobes as they are pulled by the wayward gravity of the binary system.
The two stars at the heart of the nebula circle one another roughly every 100 years. This rotation not only creates the wings of the butterfly and the two jets, it also allows the white dwarf to strip gas from its larger companion, which then forms a large disc of material around the stars, extending out as far as 15 times the orbit of Pluto! Even though this disc is of incredible size, it is much too small to be seen on the image taken by Hubble.
An earlier image of the Twin Jet Nebula using data gathered by Hubble’s Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 was released in 1997. This newer version incorporates more recent observations from the telescope’s Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS).

  <p>(Bar-Ilan University) A group of intrepid Israeli researchers recently went back to the dawn of the Stone Age to make lunch.  Using 12,500-year-old conical mortars carved into bedrock, they reconstructed how their ancient ancestors processed wild barley to produce groat meals, as well as a delicacy that might be termed ‘proto-pita’ – small loaves of coal-baked, unleavened bread.  In so doing, they re-enacted a critical moment in the rise of civilization.</p>

  <p>The first U.S. mission to return samples of an asteroid to Earth is another step closer to its fall 2016 launch, with the delivery of three cameras that will image and map the giant space rock.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A camera suite that will allow NASA’s Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) mission to see a near-Earth asteroid, map it, and pick a safe and interesting place to touch the surface and collect a sample, has arrived at Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver for installation to the spacecraft.</p>

<p>“This is another major step in preparing for our mission,” said Mike Donnelly, OSIRIS-REx project manager at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “With the delivery of the camera suite to the spacecraft contractor, we will have our full complement of cameras and spectrometers.”</p>

<p>The OSIRIS-REx mission is scheduled to launch in September 2016 to study Bennu, a near-Earth asteroid that’s about one-third of a mile (approximately 500 meters) across. After rendezvousing with Bennu in 2018, the spacecraft will survey the asteroid, obtain a sample, and return it to Earth in 2023.</p>

<p>The three camera instrument suite, known as OCAMS (OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite), was designed and built by the University of Arizona’s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory.</p>

<p>The largest of the three cameras, PolyCam, is a small telescope that will acquire the first images of Bennu from a distance of 1.2 million miles (2 million kilometers) and provide high resolution imaging of the sample site.</p>

<p>MapCam will search for satellites and dust plumes around Bennu, map the asteroid in color, and provide images to construct topographic maps. SamCam will document the sample acquisition event and the collected sample.</p>

<p>“PolyCam, MapCam and SamCam will be our mission’s eyes at Bennu,” said Dante Lauretta, principal investigator for OSIRIS-REx at the University of Arizona, Tucson. “OCAMS will provide the imagery we need to complete our mission while the spacecraft is at the asteroid.”</p>

<p>OSIRIS-REx is the first U.S. mission to sample an asteroid, and will return the largest sample from space since the Apollo lunar missions. Scientists expect that Bennu may hold clues to the origin of the solar system and the source of water and organic molecules that may have seeded life on Earth. OSIRIS-REx’s investigation will inform future efforts to develop a mission to mitigate an impact, should one be required.</p>

<p>“The most important goal of these cameras is to maximize our ability to successfully return a sample,” said OCAMS instrument scientist Bashar Rizk from the University of Arizona, Tucson. “Our mission requires a lot of activities during one trip - navigation, mapping, reconnaissance, sample site selection, and sampling. While we are there, we need the ability to continuously see what is happening around the asteroid in order to make real-time decisions.”</p>

<p>NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, provides overall mission management, systems engineering and safety and mission assurance for OSIRIS-REx. Dante Lauretta is the mission’s principal investigator at the University of Arizona, Tucson.</p>

<p>Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver is building the spacecraft. OSIRIS-REx is the third mission in NASA’s New Frontiers Program. NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, manages New Frontiers for the agency’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

<blockquote>
  <p>A lab experiment has all but nixed one of the theories of dark energy, a mysterious force pushing the universe apart.
This diagram shows changes in the rate of expansion since the Big Bang. About 7.5 billion years ago, astronomers observe the effects of a mysterious force that causes galaxies to fly apart at a faster rate. NASA / WMAP
One of the most bizarre discoveries of the 21st century was that the universe is expanding at an accelerating speed. The culprit behind this ramp-up, called dark energy for lack of a better term, is an unknown force that’s pushing the universe’s expansion so that as cosmic time goes on, galaxies fly faster and faster apart. Yet despite its implications for the fate of our universe, astronomers have no idea what dark energy is.
Now a new (and really awesome) experiment, reported in the August 21st Science, has narrowed down the field of possibilities.
Scientists have come up with a couple of ideas for the nature of dark energy. One camp supposes it’s the energy pent up in empty space itself, known as the cosmological constant. True to its name, it should stay constant from the Big Bang onward. But the theory has some problems — most notably it overpredicts the energy density of the cosmic vacuum by 120 orders of magnitude (yikes!).
Another camp instead suggests quintessence, a fifth fundamental force that doesn’t have to be constant — it could have arisen at some point in the early universe and might one day gradually fade away again. But so far scientists have failed to detect this fifth force in the lab. So in 2004 Justin Khoury and Amanda Weltman (both then at Columbia University) suggested a modified scenario: chameleons.
In the world of physics, particles and forces are two sides of the same coin, with particles acting as “force carriers.” Chameleon particles carry the chameleon force, and just like their namesakes, these particles adjust to their surroundings to hide from detection. But rather than change color, they change mass.
Amidst the high-density environs of Earth, the theory goes, chameleons take on high mass, and high-mass subatomic particles are difficult to detect. In consequence, the fifth force that they carry would become weak and all but impossible to measure. But in emptier space, chameleons shed mass. The fundamental force they represent would thus be felt over longer ranges, and could act over cosmic scales to affect the universe’s evolution.
To Catch a Chameleon
An artist’s impression shows the aluminum sphere of the experiment, the Cesium atoms (violet dots), and the laser beam that travels from one of the sphere to the other every time it flashes. Simca Bouma
Khoury and Weltman’s ingenious theory remained out of practical reach for about a decade — it was simply too difficult to test. Then in early 2014, Clare Burrage (University of Nottingham, UK) and colleagues developed an idea for an experiment that could do the trick.
The key, they said, is to use a vacuum. In a vacuum, scientists could test the chameleon force without the obscuring effects of matter. (To read the details, take a look at the excellent article, “The Chameleon in the Vacuum Chamber.”)
When Paul Hamilton (University of California, Berkeley) read Burrage and colleagues’ article, he realized that he could do the test with an experiment he had already helped develop.
Hamilton and Holger Müller (also at Berkeley) had built a small spherical vacuum chamber just 10 centimeters across with a solid aluminum sphere at the center. Into this sphere, the physicists dropped in a few (read: 10 million) cesium atoms and flashed a laser beam at them, three flashes separated by 10 milliseconds.
The first laser beam splits the cesium atoms into two packets of information. (Remember, this is quantum mechanics world, where particles can behave like waves: “splitting an atom” in this case has a probabilistic meaning that has nothing to do with actual nuclear fission.)
This photo shows the experimental set-up, with the 25-mm-diameter sphere at the center of the vacuum chamber. The experiment measures the force between the sphere and cesium atoms (not visible). Holger Mueller
Since the first beam sent the two packets recoiling away from each other, a second flash reverses their direction and sends them back together. Then a third laser beam acts as a beam splitter, causing the two cesium waves to overlap and interfere with each other, like two sets of ripples in a pond. The whole laser light show takes just 1.7 seconds.
The cesium atoms’ interference pattern will show the effect of gravity combined with the chameleon field — but the experiment found only gravity at work. With this null result, Hamilton and Müller’s team was able to rule out the existence of chameleon particles over a wide range of masses.
And in fact, the results might end up being even better than what’s reported in Science. Burrage’s theoretical work came out in early 2014, but this past July Sandrine Schlögel (University of Lamur and Louvain University, Belgium) and colleagues released a new-and-improved version of those difficult calculations. This development, says Hartmut Abele (Technical University of Vienna, Austria), may already have increased the experiment’s range, narrowing the possible masses for chameleon particles even further — by up to a factor of 10.
“The experiment by Paul Hamilton and colleagues is a huge step forward in chasing the chameleon field,” Abele concludes. “Future experiments with atoms or neutrons will either find a chameleon signal or exclude chameleon fields completely.”
Khoury agrees, stating in a press release, “[Müller] is now pushing his experiment into areas where chameleons interact on the same scale as gravity, where they are more likely to exist.”
What the Future Holds for Dark Energy
Paul Hamilton stands in the foreground with his colleagues. Enar de Dios Rodriguez
What’s significant to physicists involved in this research is that the experiment was small, done in a university lab, yet probed complex physics that had previously been out of reach. “I think it’s very reassuring,” adds Jörg Schmiedmayer (also at the Technical University of Vienna), “that the most fundamental science can sometimes be probed in clever, small-scale experiments and doesn’t always need mega collaborations and mega facilities.”
What’s even more reassuring about this result is that it promises that a definitive, yes/no answer is on the horizon. There are no free parameters to tweak, no theoretical modifications that could evade a null result — future experiments will reveal for certain whether chameleon particles exist.
But what’s less reassuring is that if they’re ruled out, then we’re back to square one: the cosmological constant or quintessence scenarios, along with all their attendant problems.

  <p>In mountainous regions earthquakes often cause strong landslides, which can be exacerbated by heavy rain. However, after an initial increase, the frequency of these mass wasting events, often enormous and dangerous, declines, in fact independently of meteorological events and aftershocks. These new findings are presented by a German-Franco-Japanese team of geoscientists in the current issue of the journal Geology, under the lead of the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences. Even after strong earthquake the activity of landslides returns back over the course of one to four years to the background level before the earthquake.</p>

  <p>The study, undertaken by Danish researchers from Aarhus University, asked what Earth would be like if humans never existed, not from a climate perspective, but simply one of biodiversity.
And from their findings posted in the journal Diversity and Distributions, it appears that Europe, in particular, has been the most devastated by human activity, with many native mammal species wiped out over the last few thousand years.
According to the news release on the findings, northern Europe without humans would not only be home to vast quantities of wolves, elks and bears, but would also likely have seen the immigration of faraway animals like the elephant or the rhinoceros.
This new study follows on from the research team’s previous study, which attributed the rise of man as the dominant species to the last Ice Age, which saw a large dying-off of many species.

However, one of the researchers on the study, Prof Jens-Christian Svenning, has stated that greater biodiversity would not have been limited to Europe, but across the world
While Africa is considered the ‘last refuge’ for the greatest biodiversity among mammals in the world today, the study shows that, in a world without humans, the Americas – both North and South – would have far, far greater biodiversity than it does today.
Explaining why Africa remains one of the very few examples of mammal biodiversity, the lead author on the study, Soren Faurby, said: “The reason that many safaris target Africa is not because the continent is naturally abnormally rich in species of mammals. Instead, it reflects that it’s one of the only places where human activities have not yet wiped out most of the large animals.”
Likewise, the existence of greater mammal diversity in mountainous regions across the world is not due to natural patterns, but rather that we humans are less likely to go up there.
“The current high level of biodiversity in mountainous areas is partly due to the fact that the mountains have acted as a refuge for species in relation to hunting and habitat destruction, rather than being a purely natural pattern,” Faurby said.
“An example in Europe is the brown bear, which now virtually only live in mountainous regions because it has been exterminated from the more accessible and most often more densely populated lowland areas.”
