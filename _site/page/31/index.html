  <p>Massive young stars are known to emit strong X-rays. Unlike the X-ray emission from lower mass stars, however, which arises in stellar photospheres, the X-rays from massive stars are thought to result from powerful shocks. Several kinds of shocks can be responsible, produced either by very strong winds driven by the star’s radiation, by the head-on collision between winds that have been magnetically channeled by the star’s magnetic field, or by wind collisions in a binary stellar system in which each stars has a wind. Sorting out the mechanisms enables astronomers to identify the most active physical processes at work, and thereby decode additional information about the star’s physical makeup and evolutionary status.</p>

Astronomers have for the first time probed the magnetic fields in the mysterious inner regions of stars, finding they are strongly magnetized. Using a technique called asteroseismology, the scientists were able to calculate the magnetic field strengths in the fusion-powered hearts of dozens of red giants, stars that are evolved versions of our sun.
"In the same way medical ultrasound uses sound waves to image the interior of the human body, asteroseismology uses sound waves generated by turbulence on the surface of stars to probe their inner properties," says Caltech postdoctoral researcher Jim Fuller, who co-led a new study detailing the research.
The findings, published in the October 23 issue of Science, will help astronomers better understand the life and death of stars. Magnetic fields likely determine the interior rotation rates of stars; such rates have dramatic effects on how the stars evolve.
Until now, astronomers have been able to study the magnetic fields of stars only on their surfaces, and have had to use supercomputer models to simulate the fields near the cores, where the nuclear-fusion process takes place. "We still don't know what the center of our own sun looks like," Fuller says.
Red giants have a different physical makeup from so-called main-sequence stars such as our sun--one that makes them ideal for asteroseismology (a field that was born at Caltech in 1962, when the late physicist and astronomer Robert Leighton discovered the solar oscillations using the solar telescopes at Mount Wilson).
The cores of red-giant stars are much denser than those of younger stars. As a consequence, sound waves do not reflect off the cores, as they do in stars like our sun. Instead, the sound waves are transformed into another class of waves, called gravity waves.
"It turns out the gravity waves that we see in the red giants do propagate all the way to the center of these stars," says co-lead author Matteo Cantiello, a specialist in stellar astrophysics from UC Santa Barbara's Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP).
This conversion from sound waves to gravity waves has major consequences for the tiny shape changes, or oscillations, that red giants undergo. "Depending on their size and internal structure, stars oscillate in different patterns," Fuller says. In one form of oscillation pattern, known as the dipole mode, one hemisphere of the star becomes brighter while the other becomes dimmer. Astronomers observe these oscillations in a star by measuring how its light varies over time.
When strong magnetic fields are present in a star's core, the fields can disrupt the propagation of gravity waves, causing some of the waves to lose energy and become trapped within the core. Fuller and his coauthors have coined the term "magnetic greenhouse effect" to describe this phenomenon because it works similarly to the greenhouse effect on Earth, in which greenhouse gases in the atmosphere help trap heat from the sun. The trapping of gravity waves inside a red giant causes some of the energy of the star's oscillation to be lost, and the result is a smaller than expected dipole mode.
In 2013, NASA's Kepler space telescope, which can measure stellar brightness variations with incredibly high precision, detected dipole-mode damping in several red giants. Dennis Stello, an astronomer at the University of Sydney, brought the Kepler data to the attention of Fuller and Cantiello. Working in collaboration with KITP director Lars Bildsten and Rafael Garcia of France's Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, the scientists showed that the magnetic greenhouse effect was the most likely explanation for dipole-mode damping in the red giants. Their calculations revealed that the internal magnetic fields of the red giants were as much as 10 million times stronger than Earth's magnetic field.
"This is exciting, as internal magnetic fields play an important role for the evolution and ultimate fate of stars," says Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics Sterl Phinney, Caltech's executive officer for astronomy, who was not involved in the study.
A better understanding of the interior magnetic fields of stars could also help settle a debate about the origin of powerful magnetic fields on the surfaces of certain neutron stars and white dwarfs, two classes of stellar corpses that form when stars die.
"The magnetic fields that they find in the red-giant cores are comparable to those of the strongly magnetized white dwarfs," Phinney says. "The fact that only some of the red giants show the dipole suppression, which indicates strong core fields, may well be related to why only some stars leave behind remnants with strong magnetic fields after they die."
The asteroseismology technique the team used to probe red giants probably will not work with our sun. "However," Fuller says, "stellar oscillations are our best probe of the interiors of stars, so more surprises are likely."
The image at the top of the page shows the nebula around the bright red supergiant star Betelgeuse that was created from images taken with the VISIR infrared camera on ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT). This structure, resembling flames emanating from the star, forms because the behemoth is shedding its material into space.

“The Suzaku satellite has opened a brand new window on the Universe and shown us that wherever you look, over vast scales, the mix of chemical elements is essentially the same” said Steven Allen, Professor of Physics at Stanford University and co-author of the study. “It’s a beautifully simple result, and another step in understanding how the Universe around us came to be.”
All of the chemical elements that are heavier than carbon, the oxygen we breathe, the silicon that makes up the sand on the beach, were produced inside stars through nuclear fusion and released by stellar explosions called supernovae. By measuring the chemical composition of the Universe, scientists are trying to reconstruct the history of how, when, and where each of the chemical elements so necessary for the evolution of life were produced.
Very generally speaking, there are two ways that a supernova explosion can take place, and the proportion of chemical elements that are produced depend on the supernova type. Lighter elements, like oxygen and magnesium, originate mainly from the explosions of very massive stars, more than 10 times the size of our Sun, at the end of their lifetimes. These are known as “core-collapse supernovae”.
Smaller stars instead usually end their life cycles as “white dwarves”, a small fraction of which can explode as a “thermonuclear” or “type Ia” supernova if they later accrete matter from a companion star, causing the white dwarf to become unstable to the pull of its own gravity. Heavier atoms like iron and nickel mostly come from this latter type of supernovae. To make up the chemical composition of our Solar System, for instance, we require a mixture of roughly one thermonuclear for every five core-collapse supernova explosions.
JAXA research fellow Aurora Simionescu wanted to find out whether the average chemical composition of the Universe was similar to that of our Solar System, or whether our local neighborhood was, after all, a special place.
Actually, perhaps counterintuitively, the answer to this question is best found not by looking at the stars themselves, but rather looking at the intergalactic space. That is because most of the normal matter in the universe, and thus also most of the metals, are presently not contained in stars, but rather in a very hot, diffuse gas that fills the space between galaxies, and is so hot that it shines in X-ray light. The brightest X-rays come from so-called clusters of galaxies, the places in the Universe where the galaxies are packed closest together.
“I’ve found this idea fascinating ever since the first year of my PhD: X-raying the chemical content of our Universe”, says Aurora Simionescu. But back then, almost 10 years ago, it was very hard to obtain reliable measurements of the metal abundances except for the very densest, brightest parts of the intergalactic medium, due to a lack of X-ray photons and high background noise. So we could only really probe the chemical composition of roughly the central one-thousandths of the typical volume of any given galaxy cluster.
JAXA’s Suzaku X-ray satellite dedicated a great amount of observing time, collecting data over many weeks, to address this problem. The first such deep observations, targeting the brightest system, the Perseus Cluster (shown at top of the page), allowed remarkably detailed measurements of the iron abundance in the intra-cluster medium on large scales. However, information about chemical elements predominantly produced by core collapse supernovae was still missing.
For such measurements, observations of a galaxy cluster with a lower average temperature were needed, in order for the emission from lighter elements to be comparatively stronger than in the Perseus Cluster. Suzaku therefore spent about two weeks looking at the Virgo Cluster, the nearest and second brightest cluster in the X-ray sky, which has such a suitably low temperature. With this new data set, Simionescu and her colleagues at JAXA and Stanford University succeeded to detect not only iron but for the first time also magnesium, silicon and sulphur all the way to the edge of this galaxy cluster. Their results are reported in a study published recently in the Astrophysical Journal.
“What we found was that the ratios between the abundances of iron, silicon, sulphur, and magnesium, are constant throughout the entire volume of the Virgo Cluster, and indeed roughly consistent with the composition of our own Sun and most of the stars in our Galaxy”, explains Dr. Norbert Werner from Stanford University, a co-author of the article. Galaxy clusters cover such a large volume that the content of each such object is believed to be representative for the rest of the Universe as well. The new Suzaku finding means that the chemical elements in the cosmos are very well mixed, with a chemical composition that remains the same from scales of the solar radius (hundreds of thousands of kilometers) to the size of a cluster of galaxies (several million light years). Although there may still be a few special places in the Universe that retain a different chemical make-up, on average, the bulk of the Universe has a very similar composition to our local neighbourhood — the same raw soup of elements that is necessary for life like ours is found, wherever you look.

Observations by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope have taken advantage of gravitational lensing to reveal the largest sample of the faintest and earliest known galaxies in the Universe. Some of these galaxies formed just 600 million years after the Big Bang and are fainter than any other galaxy yet uncovered by Hubble. The team has determined, for the first time with some confidence, that these small galaxies were vital to creating the Universe that we see today.
An international team of astronomers, led by Hakim Atek of the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland, has discovered over 250 tiny galaxies that existed only 600-900 million years after the Big Bang -- one of the largest samples of dwarf galaxies yet to be discovered at these epochs. The light from these galaxies took over 12 billion years to reach the telescope, allowing the astronomers to look back in time when the universe was still very young.
Although impressive, the number of galaxies found at this early epoch is not the team's only remarkable breakthrough, as Johan Richard from the Observatoire de Lyon, France, points out, "The faintest galaxies detected in these Hubble observations are fainter than any other yet uncovered in the deepest Hubble observations."
By looking at the light coming from the galaxies the team discovered that the accumulated light emitted by these galaxies could have played a major role in one of the most mysterious periods of the Universe's early history -- the epoch of reionisation. Reionisation started when the thick fog of hydrogen gas that cloaked the early Universe began to clear. Ultraviolet light was now able to travel over larger distances without being blocked and the Universe became transparent to ultraviolet light [2].
By observing the ultraviolet light from the galaxies found in this study the astronomers were able to calculate whether these were in fact some of the galaxies involved in the process. The team determined, for the first time with some confidence, that the smallest and most abundant of the galaxies in the study could be the major actors in keeping the Universe transparent. By doing so, they have established that the epoch of reionisation -- which ends at the point when the Universe is fully transparent -- came to a close about 700 million years after the Big Bang [3].
Lead author Atek explained, "If we took into account only the contributions from bright and massive galaxies, we found that these were insufficient to reionise the Universe. We also needed to add in the contribution of a more abundant population of faint dwarf galaxies."
To make these discoveries, the team utilised the deepest images of gravitational lensing made so far in three galaxy clusters, which were taken as part of the Hubble Frontier Fields (http://frontierfields.org/) programme [4]. These clusters generate immense gravitational fields capable of magnifying the light from the faint galaxies that lie far behind the clusters themselves. This makes it possible to search for, and study, the first generation of galaxies in the Universe.
Jean-Paul Kneib, co-author of the study from the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland, explains, "Clusters in the Frontier Fields act as powerful natural telescopes and unveil these faint dwarf galaxies that would otherwise be invisible."
These results highlight the impressive possibilities of the Frontier Fields programme with more galaxies, at even earlier time, likely to be revealed when Hubble peers at three more of these galaxy clusters in the near future.

Astrophysicists have developed a method for calculating the effect of Rayleigh scattering on photons, potentially allowing researchers to better understand the formation of the Universe. The CMB is the oldest light in the universe, which originated when electrons combined with protons to form the first atoms. These primordial atoms were also the first to Rayleigh scatter light.
University of British Columbia theoretical cosmology graduate student Elham Alipour, UBC physicist Kris Sigurdson and Ohio State University astrophysicist Christopher Hirata probed the effect of Rayleigh scattering – the process that makes the sky appear blue when the Sun’s photons are scattered by molecules in the atmosphere – on the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
“Detecting the Rayleigh signal is challenging because the frequency range where Rayleigh scattering has the biggest effect is contaminated by ‘noise’ and foregrounds, such as galactic dust,” lead author Elham Alipour said.
By using different high-frequency channels to observe the CMB and combining this information, researchers may be able to better isolate the Rayleigh signal. This calculation of the effects of Rayleigh scattering on cosmology might help us better understand the formation of our Universe 13.6 billion years ago.
“The CMB sky is a snapshot of the early Universe, it is a single frame in the movie of the Universe, and we have shown that Rayleigh signal gives us another fainter snapshot of the same scene at a slightly different time,” co-author Kris Sigurdson explained.

  <p>A Hubble legacy program has returned high-res pictures of Jupiter, revealing changes to the Great Red Spot and mysterious new wisps in the North Equatorial Belt.
Observe Jupiter through a telescope, and you’ll soon find it’s not immutable as the stars.
This image is a computer reprojection of Hubble Space Telescope data. All images/videos in this article are credited to NASA / ESA / Goddard / UC Berkeley / JPL-Caltech / STScI
It’s a place where storms rage and winds reach speeds of more than 200 miles per hour. Even long-lived features such as the Great Red Spot, which has so far survived for hundreds of years, are in flux.
Recently, astronomers started a program to have the Hubble Space Telescope send home annual photos of Jupiter and the other outer planets, like a planetary yearbook. Dubbed the Outer Planet Atmospheres Legacy (OPAL) program, the annual imaging of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune will continue as long as Hubble still flies. (For now, though, Cassini rather than Hubble will provide the pictures of Saturn. Hubble will take over whenever Cassini is decommissioned.)
Like any good photographer, OPAL will ensure that we don’t capture just a single view: each annual look will capture two full orbits so that investigators can study not just yearly changes but daily ones too.
Hubble observed its first planet in November 2014, sending back photos of mysterious bright spots in Uranus’s atmosphere. Then in January 2015, Hubble captured high-res shots of Jupiter. Watch this video to see the new view of Jupiter — it’s awesome in the most literal sense:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And these are far more than pretty pictures. The newest observations confirm that the Great Red (or should we call it orange?) Spot continues to shrink, losing girth to become more circular. Although its shrinkage had appeared to speed up in 2014, these newest observations show its back to the normal rate, decreasing in size by 0.19° of longitude (about 225 km) per year.
As it shrinks, the core of the Great Red Spot, once a distinct piece of this anticyclone and prominent at violet wavelengths, seems to have mostly disappeared. Swirling filaments have appeared in its place.
Watch the movement of Jupiter’s clouds in this comparison of the two recent global maps. Zooming in on the Great Red Spot at blue (left) and red (right) wavelengths reveals a filamentary feature that swirls around the barely existent core.
Hubble also captured a rare wave train just north of the planet’s equator in the North Equatorial Belt, a region dotted with cyclones. Such a feature hasn’t been seen in more than a decade of previous Hubble observations, spanning 1994 to 2014, nor was it seen by the Galileo or Cassini spacecraft. The only other spacecraft to spot the feature (barely) was Voyager 2 during its 1979 flyby.
This global false-color map shows the presence of cyclones along the North Equatorial Band (arrows) and two as-yet unexplained wave features (combs).
The preliminary report on Hubble’s OPAL images, in a study led by Amy Simon (NASA Goddard), appears in October 7th’s Astrophysical Journal, but there’s plenty of data here to keep Jupiterphiles busy until the next yearbook picture arrives.

  <p>What exciting new discoveries await astronomers in the field of gravitational wave astronomy?
An aerial view of LIGO Hansford.  LIGO / NSF
A new-and-improved gravitational wave observatory is open for business. After a five-year-long upgrade, the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (ALIGO) resumed its search for gravitational waves on September 18, 2015. In this first run, its sensitivity is already three times that of the initial LIGO project’s best run, and eventually it will be running at ten times the sensitivity.
When any massive body accelerates through spacetime, it acts like a paddle moving through water, generating ripples known as gravitational waves. The more massive the body and the faster it moves, the larger the ripple. But even though they’re expected from the theory of general relativity and indirectly detected in pulsar observations, gravitational waves have eluded direct detection so far. ALIGO might fix that predicament.
“It is incredibly exciting — and satisfying — to see the planning, designing, building, testing, installing, and commissioning of Advanced LIGO come together so successfully. Kudos to the whole team!” David Shoemaker, director of the MIT LIGO Laboratory, said in a press release.
The original LIGO was built to detect gravitational waves from mergers of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes. It didn’t succeed, but it never had the capability to detect anything beyond the most powerful sources. Now, with their improved sensitivity, the new ALIGO detectors could spot inspiraling binary systems 3.5 times farther away than the original LIGO project — that’s as far as 225 million light-years away. And since ALIGO can now detect gravitational waves with shorter wavelengths, the instrument could even detect supernovae exploding outside our galaxy.
Advancing to ALIGO
This diagram shows the L-shaped arms of the LIGO detector. The beam splitter sends a laser beam traveling down both arms at once, bouncing off mirrors at the ends of the arms, and traveling back to create an interference pattern that the photodetector picks up. LIGO / NSF
LIGO is a unique observatory consisting of two L-shaped detectors, one based in Livingston, Louisiana, and another on the Hanford Nuclear Reservation Site along the Columbia River in Washington State. A vacuum fills each detector, and laser beams travel up and down through this vacuum, bouncing off mirrors before returning to interfere with each other. A photodetector records the interference pattern.
A passing gravitational wave would warp spacetime, altering the length of one or both arms according to the theory of general relativity, affecting the resulting interference pattern. Keep in mind, the sort of changes ALIGO is looking for are tiny, less than 1/1000th of the width of a proton. Though the system is isolated and various mechanisms help amplify the signal, it’s still incredibly difficult to pick the signal out amidst the background noise of low-level seismic activity or human-generated rumbling.
Since gravitational waves travel at the speed of light, we wouldn’t even have time to blink before a signal passed us by. But two detectors, placed 1,865 miles apart, help researchers triangulate the signal and pinpoint its source after the fact.
Over the last five years, the LIGO team has lengthened the L-shaped arms of the detectors, replaced the laser with a more powerful one, improved the isolation from seismic activity, and made other improvements. Not only is ALIGO’s sensitivity greater, but it also has access to a slightly greater range of gravitational wave frequencies, so it could detect gravitational waves not just from inspiraling neutron stars and black holes, but also from faraway supernovae.
ALIGO’s first observing run will last three months. Then engineers will fine-tune the instruments before conducting additional runs, eventually getting ALIGO to ten times the sensitivity of the original LIGO project.
And should a detection occur, 75 observatories around the world have agreed to follow up immediately afterward, observing everything from radio waves to X-rays to determine the event’s origin.
Will ALIGO Succeed?

Astronomers have been attempting to detect gravitational waves directly since the 1960s, even before indirect evidence from pulsars supported their existence. But LIGO, a $620 million project, detected nothing in its years of operation between 2002 and 2010.
To some extent, this result was expected — detection was considered plausible for LIGO, but not likely. And to some extent, this result was useful. For example, by not detecting the primordial gravitational waves that would have been generated in the Big Bang, LIGO ruled out some more exotic versions of the theory of cosmic inflation, which describes how the universe expanded shortly after the Big Bang.
Moreover, LIGO showed that detection could be done. Scientists periodically inserted artificial signals, known as blind injections, into the data, and they were able to recover these artificial signals. If a real, loud-enough signal had passed by, LIGO would have heard it. Now, with ALIGO, the probability of detection moves from plausible to likely.
While the first direct detection of gravitational waves would surely garner scientific accolades, a non-detection from ALIGO could prove just as fruitful — not seeing anything this time around would send theorists back to the drawing board.
The Future of Gravitational Wave Astronomy
This plot compares the sensitivity and frequency range (i.e., type of gravitational-wave-producing object) for LIGO, ALIGO, and eLISA. LIGO could plausibly have detected the most powerful gravitational waves signals, but ALIGO’s better sensitivity gives it a better chance. Click for a bigger version or go to the Gravitational Wave Sensitivity Curve Plotter by Christopher Moore, Robert Cole, and Christopher Berry to plot your own version.
Future systems will push the bounds of gravitational wave astronomy even further. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) Pathfinder is scheduled to launch on December 2nd. Though this mission won’t detect gravitational waves themselves, it’s designed to test key technologies for a full mission known as eLISA (short for “evolved” LISA), which might launch sometime in the 2030s.
LIGO India will also utilize technology from a planned-for, but never-built, third LIGO array stored at the Hanford facility. Engineers expect LIGO-India to be operational in the early 2020s, and its observations will further the existing LIGO capabilities.
Looking to hunt for gravitational waves yourself? You can enlist your computer’s idle time to run Einstein@Home. Similar to the famous SETI@Home, this new project sifts through data from LIGO, Arecibo, and the Parkes Multibeam Survey to search for radio pulsars and continuous gravitational wave sources. Though Einstein@Home users haven’t detected gravitational waves yet, they have discovered 51 new pulsars as of February. And who knows what the future holds in store?
