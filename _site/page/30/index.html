An international team of physicists has published ground-breaking research on the decay of subatomic particles called kaons – which could change how scientists understand the formation of the universe. Nicolas Garron, a Research Fellow in the Centre of Mathematical Sciences, has helped to devise the first theoretical calculation of how the behaviour of kaons differs when matter – anything with mass, such as the world around us – is swapped out for antimatter – made out of similar particles with opposite charge.
The calculation of the kaon decays was conducted on supercomputers, which would have taken 200 million core processing hours on a laptop.
The rate at which the kaons decay highlights that, despite being virtually identical, there is an asymmetry between matter and antimatter. This is key to physicists’ understanding of the universe, as it’s currently accepted that the universe was created with equal parts of matter and antimatter, and, in order for matter to have overhauled its negative counterpart, the two sets of particles must have behaved differently – however slight that difference was.
Nobel prize-winning work dating back to 1964 first showed that matter and antimatter are asymmetrical, a concept known as indirect CP violation. This was built upon to a more accurate degree in 2000, to uncover direct CP violation – a tiny effect which only affects a few particle decays in a million. Now the research published today has narrowed the calculation even further, making it the first theoretical – rather than experimental – prediction of its kind.
At present, the experimental results are consistent with the theoretical calculation. But, with the road now paved for the calculation’s accuracy to be pinpointed even further, it is expected that the experimental results may not conform to the theoretical prediction – which would mean that a new mechanism must be responsible for the preponderance of matter of which we are made.
“Physicists have been waiting for more than 40 years for this kind of breakthrough," said Garron. "It sounds strange, but we’re looking for this theoretical computation not to match the experimental results, as that will mean there’s more to the behaviour of these particles than we have ever understood. The calculation is ongoing with an accuracy that is increasing rapidly, leaving the possibility that evidence of new phenomena, not described by our theory, may yet be uncovered.”
The supercomputers on which the research was conducted are housed at various institutions in the UK and in the USA. Last month, Plymouth University agreed to a major upgrade of the computing facilities, improving the present computing power by approximatively a factor of ten.
“We are also part of a consortium of research groups and share our resources with Cambridge, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Oxford, Southampton, and Swansea universities. This is a national programme called DiRAC, which supports particle physics, astronomy and cosmology, and has received £15 million since 2011. This research on matter-antimatter asymmetry, which seriously challenges our current understanding of particle physics, would not have been possible without supercomputing facilities.”
Dr Nicolas Garron is a Research Fellow in the Centre of Mathematical Sciences hosted by the School of Computing, Electronics and Mathematics at Plymouth University.
The research paper, entitled Standard Model Prediction for Direct CP Violation in K → π π Decay, is now available to view in the journal Physical Review Letters.

  <p>A black hole is so simple (at least in traditional theories) that it can be completely described by just three parameters: its mass, its spin, and its electric charge. Even though it may have formed out of a complex mix of matter and energy, all the other specific details are lost when it collapses to a singular point. The environment of a black hole is not so simple, however. As material flows in towards the black hole, a hot accretion disk develops. In galaxies with active black hole nuclei, the disks facilitate the production of powerful jets of ionized matter. In some cases the jet particles are driven to velocities close to the speed of light. These jets are thought to be powered by the rotational energy of the spinning black hole, with magnetic fields playing a pivotal role.</p>

  <p>“At such moments, the world reveals itself as quite different: a place of suffering and misguided effort … but also a place of tenderness and longing, beauty, and touching vulnerability. “</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“[Leonardo da Vinci’s] unique brain wiring … allowed him the opportunity to experience the world from the vantage point of a higher dimension,” Leonard Shlain wrote in his stimulating inquiry into the source of Leonardo’s genius. But what is “higher consciousness,” really, and can it be unmoored from the baggage of spiritualism and superstition to enrich our secular understanding of what it means to be human?</p>

<p>Few contemporary thinkers have done more to reinstate philosophy as a guiding light for public life and a practical tool for personal growth than philosopher and School of Life founder Alain de Botton, who has written beautifully about such enduring ideas as the role of art in human happiness and what Nietzsche teaches us about the character-building role of difficulty. De Botton’s fantastic recent conversation with Tim Ferriss pointed me to this equally fantastic video essay examining the question of higher consciousness.</p>

<p>As human beings, we spend most of our lives functioning in states of lower consciousness, where what we are principally concerned with is ourselves, our survival and our own success, narrowly defined.
Ordinary life rewards practical, unintrospective, self-justifying outlooks that are the hallmarks of what we could call “lower” consciousness. Neuroscientists speak of a “lower” part of the brain they term the reptilian mind and tell us that under its sway, we strike back when we’re hit, blame others, quell any stray questions that lack immediate relevance, fail to free-associate, and stick closely to a flattering image of who we are and where we are heading.
However, at rare moments, when there are no threats or demands upon us, perhaps late at night or early in the morning, when our bodies and passions are comfortable and quiescent, we have the privilege of being able to access the higher mind — what neuroscientists call our neocortex, the seat of imagination, empathy and impartial judgement. We loosen our hold on our own egos and ascend to a less biased and more universal perspective, casting off a little of the customary anxious self-justification and brittle pride.
In such states, the mind moves beyond its particular self-interests and cravings. We start to think of other people in a more imaginative way. Rather than criticize and attack, we are free to imagine that their behavior is driven by pressures derived from their own more primitive minds, which they are generally in no position to tell us about. Their temper or viciousness are, we now see, symptoms of hurt rather than of “evil.”
It’s an astonishing gradual evolution to develop the ability to explain others’ actions by their distress, rather than simply in terms of how it affects us. We perceive that the appropriate response to humanity is not fear, cynicism or aggression, but always — when we can manage it — love. At such moments, the world reveals itself as quite different: a place of suffering and misguided effort, full of people striving to be heard and lashing out against others, but also a place of tenderness and longing, beauty, and touching vulnerability. 
The fitting response is universal sympathy and kindness.
[…]
States of higher consciousness are, of course, desperately short lived. We shouldn’t in any case aspire to make them permanent, because they don’t sit so well with the many important practical tasks we all need to attend to. But we should make the most of them when they arise, and harvest their insights for the time when we require them most. Higher consciousness is a huge triumph over the primitive mind which cannot envisage any such possibilities. Ideally, we would be a little more alive to the advantages of this higher mind and strive to make our oceanic experiences somewhat less random and less clothed in unnecessary mystery.
The film is part of the excellent School of Life series that has previously examined what great books do for the soul, how to stop letting habit blunt our aliveness, what philosophy is for, how to find fulfilling work, and what comes after religion.

“The Higgs mass that we measure is consistent with the Standard Model if the parameters of the model are carefully tuned to something like 30 decimal places,” said Joe Incandela, a UC Santa Barbara physics professor and scientist in CERN's Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, one of four detectors located along the LHC 16-mile collider tunnel. “This seems very unnatural to us. When you introduce new physics, like supersymmetry, things come into balance and you do not have to tune anymore. We’re trying to find the evidence for supersymmetry for this reason, and because we know there’s dark matter, which is also predicted in supersymmetry models. So all in all, we’re looking for the bridge to the next chapter of the story.”
New physics beyond the Standard Model and the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism may be discovered as a result of the upgrades to the accelerator and its detectors, as well as clues to understanding dark matter and supersymmetry. Among the mysteries the scientists at CERN are trying to solve is how the Brout-Englert-Higgs boson, discovered in 2012, could exist at the low mass it was found to have.
CERN scientists and engineers are meeting to kicking off the plans for upgrades to parts of the Large Hadron Collider and its detectors. The High Luminosity LHC project has resulted in plans for new technologies and innovations to elements such as the accelerator’s magnets, optics and superconducting links.
“The LHC already delivers proton collisions at the highest energy (13 TeV) and the highest luminosity ever achieved by an accelerator,” said CERN Director General Rolf Heuer. “Yet the LHC has only delivered 1 percent of the total planned number of collisions.” The upgrade to what will become the HL-LHC he said, is expected to produce 10 times more collisions than the current LHC will have created in its first decade, and will extend the potential to make discoveries.
 

 
 
“Basically, we’re quite happy,” said Incandela. “At this meeting we basically agreed that the plans are solid, the costs are reasonable, and so we can move forward now to get them done and ready to install in roughly eight years from now.”
To make the most of of the more intense beams and the higher probability of collisions Incandela and colleagues, have been working on additions and improvements to the detector that are aimed at increasing its sensitivity.
Among the improvements already in play at CMS is the installation of an additional muon detecting layer, and improved electronics for the muon system. The new electronics involve a substantial contribution from UCSB. Muons are often found in events of keen interest to the scientists and it is important to detect them efficiently and to reconstruct them accurately, said the reserachers. The recently completed upgrades represent significant improvements in these areas
Meanwhile, Incandela and his team are working on the High Granularity Calorimeter, an upgrade to the existing calorimeter on the CMS detector that would enable continued operation in regions where the density of particles produced in each beam crossing is enormous. Thanks to new superconducting quadrupole magnets that focus the proton beams as they whip around the accelerator tunnel, radiofrequency “crab cavities” that will tilt these more intense beams to increase the area where they overlap and other improvements to the LHC accelerator complex, the LHC will vastly increase the number of collisions that will occur and with it, the likelihood of generating particles of interest and rare processes.
“Each time the beams cross — which happens about 33 million times each second — there will be as many as 200 pairs of protons colliding,” Incandela said.
But with more collisions comes more debris to sift through. In any beam crossing event, at most one pair of proton-proton collisions will be interesting, said Incandela, and the rest will produce more than a thousand high-energy particles that create noise all over the apparatus, especially in the regions near the beam line itself.
“For some of the most important physics that we do, we have to be able to pull out important information from these regions,” he said. “Not only does the HGC have to withstand a huge amount of radiation over 10 years of operation, it must also provide the scientists the information needed to recognize important processes that are key to the search for new physics.”
To help separate the particles of interest from the background of debris created by hundreds of other simultaneous proton-proton collisions, the new calorimeter will exchange a system with roughly 10,000 sensing elements for one with roughly 10 million sensing elements. It would be the first time a calorimeter of this basic type has ever been operated in the intense environment of a proton collider, said Incandela, and it will be by far the most complex and largest of its type ever built. Assuming it works as expected, he added, it is likely to be the design of choice for calorimeters in many future high-energy physics experiments.
And there will be a huge amount of information to sift through: It is estimated that the High Granularity Calorimeter alone will produce around 1,000 trillion bits of data per second, about 10 percent of which are used in real time to help select beam crossing events of interest. Only one in 3,000 events will be recorded for offline analysis.

This “ascending process” is well known to specialists as a unique trait of dinosaurs. However, until the late 20th century, many scientists were doubtful about the dinosaur-bird link. Some pointed out that the ascending process in most birds was a projection of the neighbouring heel bone, rather than the anklebone. If so, it would not be comparable, and would not support the dinosaur-bird link. </p>

From possible ice volcanoes to geologically diverse surfaces to oddly behaving moons that could have formed through mergers of smaller moons, Pluto system discoveries continue to surprise scientists on NASA’s New Horizons mission team.
“The New Horizons mission has taken what we thought we knew about Pluto and turned it upside down,” said Jim Green, director of planetary science at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “It’s why we explore – to satisfy our innate curiosity and answer deeper questions about how we got here and what lies beyond the next horizon.”
“It’s hard to imagine how rapidly our view of Pluto and its moons are evolving as new data stream in each week. As the discoveries pour in from those data, Pluto is becoming a star of the solar system,” said mission Principal Investigator Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, Colorado. “Moreover, I’d wager that for most planetary scientists, any one or two of our latest major findings on one world would be considered astounding. To have them all is simply incredible.”

 
 
 
 
In one such discovery, New Horizons geologists have combined images of Pluto’s surface to make 3-D maps that indicate that two of Pluto’s most distinctive mountains could be cryovolcanoes—ice volcanoes that may have been active in the recent geological past.
The two cryovolcano candidates are large features measuring tens of miles (tens of kilometers) across and several miles or kilometers high. “These are big mountains with a large hole in their summit, and on Earth that generally means one thing—a volcano,” said Oliver White, New Horizons postdoctoral researcher with NASA’s Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California. While their appearance is similar to volcanoes on Earth that spew molten rock, ice volcanoes on Pluto are expected to emit a somewhat melted slurry of substances such as water ice, nitrogen, ammonia, or methane on Pluto.
White stresses that the team’s interpretation of these features as volcanoes is tentative. However, “If they are volcanic, then the summit depression would likely have formed via collapse as material is erupted from underneath. The strange hummocky texture of the mountain flanks may represent volcanic flows of some sort that have travelled down from the summit region and onto the plains beyond, but why they are hummocky, and what they are made of, we don't yet know.”
If Pluto is proven to have volcanoes, it will provide an important new clue to its geologic and atmospheric evolution. “After all, nothing like this has been seen in the deep outer solar system,” said Jeffrey Moore, New Horizons Geology, Geophysics and Imaging team leader, also from NASA Ames.
Another of the more surprising findings from New Horizons is the wide range of surface ages found on Pluto, from ancient to intermediate to relatively young in geological terms.
Crater counts used to determine surface unit ages indicate that Pluto has ancient surface areas dating to just after the formation of the planets, about 4 billion years ago. In addition, there’s a vast area that was geologically born “yesterday,” meaning it may have formed within the past 10 million years. This area – informally named Sputnik Planum – appears on the left side of Pluto’s “heart” and is completely impact-free in all images returned to date.
 

 
Scientists wondered if Sputnik Planum’s smooth, icy plains were an oddity; did a recent geological episode form the plains long after all other geologic activity ceased?
Locations of more than 1,000 craters mapped on Pluto by NASA’s New Horizons mission indicate a wide range of surface ages, which likely means that Pluto has been geologically active throughout its history.
Apparently not. New data from crater counts reveal the presence of intermediate or “middle-aged” terrains on Pluto as well. This suggests that Sputnik Planum is not an anomaly—that Pluto has been geologically active throughout much of its more than 4-billion-year history. “We’ve mapped more than a thousand craters, which vary greatly in size and appearance,” said postdoctoral researcher Kelsi Singer, of the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado. “Among other things, I expect cratering studies like these to give us important new insights into how this part of the solar system formed.”
Crater counts are giving the New Horizons team insight into the structure of the Kuiper Belt itself. The dearth of smaller craters across Pluto and its large moon Charon indicate that the Kuiper Belt likely had fewer smaller objects than some models had predicted. This leads New Horizons scientists to doubt a longstanding model that all Kuiper Belt objects formed by accumulating much smaller objects of less than a mile wide. The absence of small craters on Pluto and Charon support other models theorizing that Kuiper Belt objects tens of miles across may have formed directly, at their current—or close to current—size.
In fact, the evidence that many Kuiper Belt objects could have been “born large” has scientists excited that New Horizons’ next potential target – the 30-mile-wide (40-50 kilometer wide) KBO named 2014 MU69 – which may offer the first detailed look at just such a pristine, ancient building block of the solar system. Most inner moons in the solar system keep one face pointed toward their central planet; this animation shows that certainly isn’t the case with the small moons of Pluto, which behave like spinning tops. Pluto is shown at center with, in order, from smaller to wider orbit: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra.
The New Horizons mission is also shedding new light on Pluto’s fascinating system of moons and their unusual properties. For example, nearly every other moon in the solar system, including Earth’s moon, is in synchronous rotation, but not so of Pluto’s small moons. These small satellites are spinning much faster, with Hydra – the most distant moon - rotating an unprecedented 89 times during a single lap around Pluto. Scientists believe these spin rates could be chaotic (i.e., variable) because Charon exerts a strong torque that prevents each small moon from settling down into synchronous rotation, which means keeping one face toward the planet.
Another oddity of Pluto’s moons: scientists expected the satellites to wobble, but not to this degree. “Pluto’s moons are behaving like spinning tops,” said co-investigator Mark Showalter of the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California.
Images of Pluto’s four smallest satellites also indicate that several of them could have been born from mergers of two or more former moons, suggesting the presence of more moons at some point. “We suspect from this that Pluto had more moons in the past, in the aftermath of the big impact that also created Charon,” said Showalter.
New Horizons data indicates that at least two (and possibly all four) of Pluto’s small moons may be the result of mergers between still smaller moons. If this discovery is borne out with further analysis, it could provide important new clues to the formation of the Pluto system.
The New Horizons team is presenting new data at DPS that reveal Pluto’s upper atmosphere is significantly colder and therefore more compact than Earth-based models had indicated. As a result, scientists have discovered that Pluto’s atmospheric escape rate is thousands of times lower than had been thought. It now appears that Pluto’s atmosphere escapes by the same mechanism as do gases from the atmospheres of Earth and Mars – rather than the previously believed escape process that more resembled escape from cometary atmospheres.
New Horizons is part of NASA's New Frontiers Program, managed by the agency's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, designed, built, and operates the New Horizons spacecraft and manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The Southwest Research Institute leads the science mission, payload operations, and encounter science planning.
Scientists using New Horizons images of Pluto's surface to make 3-D topographic maps have discovered that two of Pluto’s mountains, informally named Wright Mons and Piccard Mons, could possibly be ice volcanoes. The color is shown to depict changes in elevation, with blue indicating lower terrain and brown showing higher elevation; green terrains are at intermediate heights.

New calculations suggest that vast valley networks that spider across the southern highlands of Mars may have been carved by a surprisingly small volume of water. The study, published in the November issue of Planetary and Space Science, finds that the minimum water volume required to carve the valleys could have flowed through in as little as a few hundred to 10,000 years. The findings are consistent with the idea that early Mars may have been cold and icy, with water flowing sporadically on the surface in response to short-term climate changes, say the Brown University researchers who led the study.
“The valley networks represent much of the evidence for why many scientists think ancient Mars was warm and wet, which implies that there was a lot of water flowing for a long period of time — perhaps millions of years,” said Jim Head, the Louis and Elizabeth Scherck Distinguished Professor of the Geological Sciences and co-author of the new paper. “But this analysis suggests that the valleys could have been carved by a smaller volume of water over a potentially shorter period of time. That gives us guidance about trying to understand what was really going on with the early Mars climate.”
The Martian valley networks were first discovered during the Mariner 9 mission in the 1970s. The branching channels, typically up to four kilometers wide, often stretch for thousands of kilometers across the southern highlands, some of the most ancient surfaces on the Red Planet.
The waters that carved the valleys are thought to have stopped running as much as 4 billion years ago. That makes figuring out just how much water flowed through the valleys “a very difficult calculation to do,” said Eliott Rosenberg, an undergraduate student at Brown who led the research.
For starters, Rosenberg needed to figure out exactly how much sediment had been excavated from the valleys. He used data from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) to get an average cross-sectional area for the valleys. He multiplied that by previous measurements of the length of the valleys to get a sediment volume.
The harder part, however, was figuring out how much water it would take to move that volume of sediment. One way of doing that requires estimating the ratio of sediment and water that traveled through the valleys per unit of time. Since the rivers are long gone, previous researchers could only make guesses at the ratio. Rosenberg wanted to find something a bit more concrete.
In the course of his research, he came across a report by the Texas Department of Transportation assessing how well different types of drainage tunnels are able to handle sediment fluxes. Within that report was raw data on fluid and sediment transport for a large number of rivers and streams. Using those data, Rosenberg found that he could get a decent estimate of the fluid/sediment ratio if he could figure out the strength of the flow.
“The strength of the flow through the valleys turns out to be something we can estimate,” Rosenberg said. “It’s a function of the slope of the valleys — which we could get from the MOLA data — as well as the depth of the flow and the size of the grains on the riverbed, because that affects how fast the water can flow and how much sediment it can pick up,” Rosenberg said.
Using the morphology of the valleys and established hydrological equations, Rosenberg estimated the depth of the ancient Martian rivers to be between 1 meter and 16 meters deep and a minimum grain size to be between 1 mm and 6.2 mm. The grain size yielded by those theoretical calculations turns out to be a close match for the grain sizes the Curiosity rover found in Gale Crater, a nice confirmation of the theoretical approach.
Using those numbers, Rosenberg was able to estimate a flow strength for the Martian rivers. He could then use the raw data from rivers on Earth to estimate a total water volume.
The calculations yielded a volume of between three and 100 GEL (global equivalent layer). GEL is a commonly used term when scientists discuss water on Mars. It means that if one were to take all the water that flowed through the valleys over time and spread it evenly across the Martian surface, it would be between three and 100 meters deep. That might sound like a lot of water, but it’s actually quite a small amount, the researchers say. Mars is considered to be a very dry place at present, yet its current water inventory, most of which is trapped in frozen ice caps, is around 34 meters GEL.
“This means that the amount of water that we calculate may have flowed through the valleys is on the same order as the amount of water on the planet today,” Head said. “The implication here is that the valleys may well have been carved by a much smaller volume of water than many people previously thought.”
Rosenberg and Head estimate that the volume of water yielded by these calculations could have flowed through the valleys in a few hundred years to 10,000 years. That’s a much shorter period than the millions of years of flowing water often envisioned for early Mars.
The researchers point out that the assumptions they used were aimed at finding the minimum amount of water required to carve the valleys. It could indeed have been more, but it didn’t necessarily need to be.
“What we’re saying is that you could still form these valleys even if ancient Mars wasn’t all beach balls and cabanas,” Head said. “The warm and wet model of ancient Mars is very hard to square with estimates of the ancient Martian climate. This work makes the case that these valley networks could still form if Mars was cold and icy with shorter periods flowing water.”

Major international collaboration has seen its first neutrinos – so-called ‘ghost particles,’ subatomic, almost massless high-energy  particles that only interact via gravity or nuclear decay, generated in cosmic accelerators: black holes, massive exploding stars and the energetic cores of galaxies.Because they don’t interact with light, they can’t be seen. Neutrinos carry no electric charge and travel through the universe almost entirely unaffected by natural forces. They are considered a fundamental building block of matter. The 2015 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded for neutrino oscillations, a phenomenon that is of great important to the field of elementary particle physics.
An international team of scientists at the MicroBooNE physics experiment in the US, including researchers from the University of Cambridge, detected their first neutrino candidates. It represents a milestone for the project, involving years of hard work and a 40-foot-long particle detector that is filled with 170 tons of liquid argon.
“It’s nine years since we proposed, designed, built, assembled and commissioned this experiment,” said Bonnie Fleming, MicroBooNE co-spokesperson and a professor of physics at Yale University. “That kind of investment makes seeing first neutrinos incredible.”
Following a 13-week shutdown for maintenance, Fermilab’s accelerator complex near Chicago delivered a proton beam on Thursday, which is used to make the neutrinos, to the laboratory’s experiments. After the beam was turned on, scientists analysed the data recorded by MicroBooNE’s particle detector to find evidence of its first neutrino interactions.
Scientists at the University of Cambridge have been working on advanced image reconstruction techniques that contributed to the ability to identify the rare neutrino interactions in the MicroBooNE data.
The MicroBooNE experiment aims to study how neutrinos interact and change within a distance of 500 meters. The detector will help scientists reconstruct the results of neutrino collisions as finely detailed, three-dimensional images. MicroBooNE findings also will be relevant for the forthcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), which will examine neutrino transitions over longer distances.
“Future neutrino experiments will use this technology,” said Sam Zeller, Fermilab physicist and MicroBooNE co-spokesperson. “We’re learning a lot from this detector. It’s important not just for us, but for the whole physics community.”
“This is an important step towards the much larger Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE)”, said Professor Mark Thomson of Cambridge’s Cavendish Laboratory, co-spokesperson of the DUNE collaboration and member of MicroBooNE. “It is the first time that fully automated pattern recognition software has been used to identify neutrino interactions from the complex images in a detector such as MicroBooNE and the proposed DUNE detector.”

<blockquote>
  <p>New Horizons’ principal investigator describes the most amazing discoveries made when NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft flew past Pluto last July.
It sounds like science fiction, but it’s not: NASA’s New Horizons mission explored the Pluto system last summer — and here’s my “top 10” list of what’s surprised me the most about the results so far. (By the way, I didn’t order this list below in terms of my “surprise factor.”)
Pluto’s five moons are shown to scale. Charon, 1,212 km (751 miles) across, is by far the largest. The others have irregular shapes. NASA / JHU-APL / SWRI
No New Moons. I don’t know about you, but I sure expected that we’d find more satellites circling Pluto. After finding four moons with successively deeper searches by the Hubble Space Telescope, I’m still amazed that our spacecraft searched with 20 to 30 times better sensitivity than Hubble and found nothing. Nada. Zip.
Pluto is Bigger Than Eris. Before the flyby, Pluto’s diameter was somewhat uncertain, with most estimates being between 2,300 and 2,400 km (though some researchers put the lower limit down as far as 2,280 km). By comparison, we knew the diameter of Eris is 2,326 ±12 km, and much of the safe money was on Pluto being the second biggest body in the Kuiper Belt. But now, thanks to images from New Horizons, we’ve measured Pluto’s diameter accurately — it’s 2,374 ±6 km — making Pluto the clear king of the Kuiper Belt.
Two ranges of ice mountains on Pluto have been informally named Hillary Montes (left of center) and Norgay Montes (far right) for Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, the first two humans to reach the summit of Mount Everest in 1953. NASA / JHU-APL / SWRI
Tall Mountains. Actually, I’m not surprised that we found mountains — what surprises me is that there are so many of them and that some tower 3 to 4 km or higher in altitude. Nothing like that was seen by Voyager on Triton — a body about Pluto’s size that once orbited in the Kuiper Belt. I think this just goes to show that we should expect lots of variety among the biggest bodies in the Kuiper Belt.
A small patch of surface near Pluto’s equator exhibits what appear to be sets of dunes.NASA / JHU-APL / SWRI
Dunes. There appear to be dune fields on Pluto’s surface. This is completely surprising because Pluto’s atmosphere isn’t dense enough to create the wind to shape surface particles into dunes. My personal bet is that the dune fields (and some of the dendritic networks we see geologically as well) are telling us that Pluto’s atmosphere was much thicker at some point (or points) in the past.
Sootlike haze particles in Pluto’s thin atmosphere scatter light in a way that colors the sky blue.NASA / JHU-APL / SWRI
Blue Skies. Pluto’s atmospheric haze creates a blue sky at both sunrise and sunset, due to the same process (Rayleigh scattering) that makes Earth’s skies blue. Years ago, we calculated whether Rayleigh scattering would be effective at Pluto’s tenuous atmospheric pressure — just 0.00001 that on Earth — and we concluded there would be no significant blue-sky signature. So we never thought about hazes in the atmosphere creating a blue cast until we found it in our color imagery.
Pluto’s Complexity. Before the flyby we knew Pluto would be complicated — spectroscopy had established that frozen nitrogen (N2), methane (CH4), and carbon monoxide (CO) coat parts of the surface; atmospheric pressure increased from the 1980s to the 2000s; albedo spots varied over time; there’s a complex system of satellites; and more.
But honestly, the complexity and variety of Pluto’s color, composition, and surface morphology are way beyond what I expected. We imagined Pluto to be “Triton on steroids,” but what we got instead was another Mars. Some might even say we got “Mars on steroids” — if our growing notions of kaleidoscopic variations occurring over time pan out.
Informally named Sputnik Planum (Sputnik Plain), this vast, craterless plain appears to be divided into irregularly shaped segments rimmed by narrow troughs. NASA / JHU-APL / SWRI
Current Activity. I expected that we’d find geysers, as occur on Triton, but so far we haven’t. That’s a small surprise in my book.
A much bigger one is the discovery of the 1,000-km-wide ice plain that we informally call Sputnik Planum. Amazingly, it has no detectable impact craters, which means it can’t be any older than perhaps 100 million years and might be much younger.
That blows my mind! Somehow, 4 billion years after its formation, Pluto’s internal engine is still active, creating vast landforms. How does it do that?
The large, bright “heart” in this view of Pluto has been informally named Tombaugh Regio. NASA / JHU-APL / SwRI 
Pluto Has a Heart! A vast, bright, heart-shaped region could be seen on Pluto by New Horizons from 70 million miles away. Given its prominence, our team gave it the informal moniker Tombaugh Regio, to honor of Pluto’s discoverer, Clyde Tombaugh.
The surprise here isn’t that such a feature exists — it’s the public-relations bonanza it provided. Pluto’s big “heart” emotionally connected all kinds of people who normally don’t care at all about planetary exploration.
This false-color composite, created using blue, red, and near-infrared images, highlights the dramatic surface variations across Charon. NASA / JHU-APL / SWRI
Charon’s Complexity. Before the flyby, we thought Pluto’s moon Charon had little color or compositional variation, virtually no brightness variations or clear surface markings, no detectable atmosphere, and no variability over time. Our telescopic scrutiny suggested it was a run-of-the-mill ice ball like a Uranian moons.
But high-resolution imaging by New Horizons has revealed a world with its own complex geological history, some new kinds of landforms (like mountains in dry moats), a dark polar stain that we simply don’t understand, and varying crater densities and colors that are truly remarkable.
Charon is clearly among the most complex solid-surface worlds of the outer solar system, and that just wasn’t expected. I know I am not alone on this one: Charon’s complexity caught a lot of planetary scientists by surprise.
NASA / Bill Ingalls
Flowing Glaciers. Who would have thought we’d have seen unambiguous evidence for glacial flow in Pluto’s ices? Perhaps in retrospect this was something we should have expected. But when we discovered that telltale evidence in the very first New Horizons images sent to Earth after closest approach, it really struck home what a vibrant planet Pluto is.
If you’ve seen a crazy picture of me taken back in mid-July with my eyes bulging and mouth agape, Pluto’s flowing glaciers was the discovery I was reacting to!
In the northwestern region of Pluto’s Sputnik Planum, swirl-shaped patterns of light and dark suggest that a surface layer of exotic ices has flowed around obstacles and into depressions, much like glaciers on Earth.NASA / JHU-APL / SWRI
I noted at the beginning that this is my list so far. For the next 10 months or so, New Horizons will be transmitting data from the Pluto flyby virtually every day. Since most of the encounter’s results are still stored on the spacecraft, including many high-resolution images, my “top 10” list will likely change as we learn more and more. I can’t wait to see what other surprises are coming in the weeks and months ahead!</p>

Researchers are sifting through an avalanche of data produced by one of the largest cosmological simulations ever performed, run on the Titan supercomputer at DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The project modeled the evolution of the universe from just 50 million years just 50 million years after the Big Bang to the present day -- from its earliest infancy to its current adulthood. Over the course of 13.8 billion years, the matter in the universe clumped together to form galaxies, stars and planets; but we're not sure precisely how.
These kinds of simulations help scientists understand dark energy, a form of energy that affects the expansion rate of the universe, including the distribution of galaxies, composed of ordinary matter, as well as dark matter that no instrument has directly measured so far.
Intensive sky surveys with powerful telescopes, like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the new, more detailed Dark Energy Survey, show scientists where galaxies and stars were when their light was first emitted. And surveys of the Cosmic Microwave Background, light remaining from when the universe was only 300,000 years old, show us how the universe began -- "very uniform, with matter clumping together over time," said Katrin Heitmann, an Argonne physicist who led the simulation.
The simulation fills in the temporal gap to show how the universe might have evolved in between: "Gravity acts on the dark matter, which begins to clump more and more, and in the clumps, galaxies form," said Heitmann.
Called the Q Continuum, the simulation involved half a trillion particles -- dividing the universe up into cubes with sides 100,000 kilometers long. This makes it one of the largest cosmology simulations at such high resolution. It ran using more than 90 percent of the supercomputer. For perspective, typically less than one percent of jobs use 90 percent of the Mira supercomputer at Argonne, said officials at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, a DOE Office of Science User Facility . Staff at both the Argonne and Oak Ridge computing facilities helped adapt the code for its run on Titan.
"This is a very rich simulation," Heitmann said. "We can use this data to look at why galaxies clump this way, as well as the fundamental physics of structure formation itself."
Analysis has already begun on the two and a half petabytes of data that were generated, and will continue for several years, she said. Scientists can pull information on such astrophysical phenomena as strong lensing, weak lensing shear, cluster lensing and galaxy-galaxy lensing.
The code to run the simulation is called Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code (HACC), which was first written in 2008, around the time scientific supercomputers broke the petaflop barrier (a quadrillion operations per second). HACC is designed with an inherent flexibility that enables it to run on supercomputers with different architectures.
Details of the work are included in the study, "The Q continuum simulation: harnessing the power of GPU accelerated supercomputers," published in August in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series by the American Astronomical Society.

  <p>An innovative Earth-observing satellite now shows near-daily views of our home planet online.

After a long journey from its conception to its launch and orbit, the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) is now providing nearly daily views of our home planet online. It’s orbiting the Sun in step with Earth, beaming back the view from its L1 Lagrange point perspective about a million miles sunward.
Initially conceived as the NASA Tirana satellite in the late 1990s, and nicknamed ‘GoreSat’ for former Vice President Al Gore’s backing of the project, the mission evolved into the current DISCOVR satellite operated by NASA, the NOAA, and the U.S. Air Force.
Anyone can now access views of Earth in full illumination, reminiscent of the iconic ‘blue marble’ image shot by astronauts returning aboard Apollo 17.

Launched from Cape Canaveral atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on February 11th this year, DSCOVR follows Earth in its orbit around the Sun, circling the point between Earth and the Sun where gravity from the two points cancels out, known as the first Lagrangian point. Because the satellite can’t stay exactly on the L1 point, it orbits in what’s known as a ‘halo’ or Lissajous orbit around L1. The joint NASA/ESA mission SOHO is in a similar orbit about the L1 point. To date, the deployment of DSCOVR by SpaceX is the most distant fielded by the company’s Falcon 9 rocket.

The images you see online at epic.gsfc.nasa.gov come courtesy of the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC). The webpage notes the satellite’s position relative to the Sun and Earth, as well as the zenith points for both. EPIC’s field of view extends about 0.6 degrees wide and its resolution is about one arc second. In addition to monitoring weather patterns, EPIC will also peer through Earth’s atmosphere in the ultraviolet and infrared bands, monitoring everything from cloud dynamics to ozone and aerosol levels.
Earth’s Moon in its new phase occasionally ‘photobombs’ EPIC’s view, as it did earlier this summer, turning its unfamiliar far side toward the spacecraft, affording a unique and spectacular view.
“There will be a total solar eclipse on March 8-9, 2016 visible on the ground from the Southern Pacific,” says Adam Szabo, DSCOVR project scientist. “The Moon is not big enough to block sunlight for the whole disk of Earth. That is why total eclipses are only visible from a narrow region of Earth. From space, with DSCOVR, we should see the shadow of the Moon moving across the disk of Earth.”
Far beyond pretty pictures, DSCOVR is also providing essential climate science. In addition to instruments that monitor solar activity and the near-Earth space-weather environment, the National Institute of Standards and Technology Advanced Radiometer (NISTAR) will measure the total amount of the Sun’s irradiance that Earth reflects and emits, monitoring the spectrum from ultraviolet to infrared wavelengths. The overall energy budget of heat absorbed versus heat reflected back to space is a key piece of the climate change puzzle, and DSCOVR will scrutinize this balance in unprecedented detail.
“The DSCOVR mission has a 2-year required lifetime,” says Szabo. “After a very accurate launch by SpaceX, minimizing our correction burns, we have fuel for a considerably longer period of time. . . . We are hoping for at least five years.”

An international team of astronomers at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics has been scouring cosmic images of X-ray emission, hunting for elusive clues that reveal the culprit responsible for violent acts that have left deep scars on the heart of the Milky Way. The prime suspect is the supermassive black hole lurking at the center of the Milky Way, with a number of massive stars also implicated as suicide bombers.
The X-ray broad-band mosaic image above is from more than a hundred individual XMM-Newton observations within the central degree of the Milky Way. The colors indicate observations at different energies; this map covers a region about 500 hundred light years across. In addition to the X-ray emission from the regions around the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way this map reveals X-ray binaries, star clusters, supernova remnants, bubbles and superbubbles, non-thermal filaments and many other sources.
The study of the X-ray emission from the Galactic center is of primary importance for astronomy. One of the first large projects approved and performed by the X-ray satellite XMM-Newton, right after launch, was a scan of the Galactic center. A team lead by scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) has recently obtained a new scan with XMM-Newton and connected these observations to all archival data to obtain the best maps in both X-ray continuum and line emission produced so far.
With this, the team was able to characterize in detail the fallout from catastrophic events that have released vast amounts of energy. The forensic study led in particular to the discovery of how enormous X-ray emitting bubbles of plasma, tens of light years across, are impacting their environment, creating giant cavities in the gas, dust and cooler plasma at the Milky Way’s center.
One of the most telling clues from the X-ray images is a pair of bipolar “lobes” that extend for tens of light years above and below the Galactic plane and are centered on the location of the supermassive black hole. Previous circumstantial evidence had implicated the black hole in this mayhem, but the new findings effectively catch it and its stellar gang red-handed in the act of committing acts of violence. In fact, the sources of matter and energy needed to inflate these bipolar lobes with hot, X-ray emitting gas could be either outflows launched from very near the event horizon of the super-massive black hole, winds from massive stars orbiting around the hole, or catastrophic events associated with the death of massive stars close to it.
Zoom into the central 100 light years of the Milky Way center, where here only the soft X-ray emission is shown. The Galactic black hole and its surrounding emission are located in the brightest central region of the image, and the bipolar lobes appear above and below that location.
 

 
 
The team also discovered fingerprints of warm plasma in the outskirts of the imaged region (hundreds of light years). This indicates that the acts of violence taking place at the center of the Milky Way have effects that extend far beyond that region. The newly discovered plasma might be associated with an inhomogeneous hot “atmosphere” of hot gas permeating the Galaxy’s central regions, perhaps fed by continuous or episodic outflows of mass and energy from the Milky Way’s core. Similar structures are occasionally observed at the centers of other galaxies. However, thanks to the proximity of the Milky Way center, the XMM-Newton maps can directly image this phenomenon in superb detail.
Another major disturbance in this unruly region has also been discovered: a few “superbubbles”, gigantic cavities tens of light years across that contain hot plasma emitting soft X-rays. One such region has an energy content of at least 1051 erg (approximately the total energy emitted by the Sun in its 10 billion year lifetime)! The evidence indicates that this enormous structure was inflated over the past tens of thousands years by powerful winds from the most massive stars of the spectacular Quintuplet stars cluster and by catastrophic events such as explosions of massive stars. Such large energy releases have a profound impact on the evolution of interstellar matter at the Galactic center.
So, while the crime scene reconstruction is still being pieced together, with these new X-ray images the astronomers have a much clearer idea of what might have happened over the past couple billion years – and how our Milky Way might continue to evolve in future. One thing is clear: the violence in the neighborhood of the Galactic center will undoubtedly continue well into the future.
The Galactic Centre XMM-Newton monitoring project is supported by the Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie/Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (BMWI/DLR, FKZ 50 OR 1408) and the Max Planck Society.
