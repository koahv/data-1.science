When managing several systems per day, you will be wondering why you ever used password based authentication before. Creating the key Depending on your desktop platform, we first have to create a key pair. This will consist of a public and private key, which are both needed to work. The private key is private and should remain private. While not mandatory, it is very wise to protect it with a password. The public...

The main goal is hiding its presence and avoid the eye of the system administrator. Rootkits usually consist of a set of tools, to manipulate the Linux kernel, alter output to the screen or avoid some software from doing its tasks. Nowadays rootkits are less popular than they were before. One of the reasons is the increased security in the Linux kernel, making it harder to circumvent some areas (like using some system calls). Still they occur, or in a slightly different form. For example backdoors are still very popular. Often the attacker doesn&#8217;t even need full root access to abuse a system for other purposes....

>Recently, on Twitter and Facebook I noticed graphs of climate change and its impacts being posted. Â These were often unaccompanied with data sources or links.Â A lot of misinformation occurs across the web in both denial and support of climate change. Beyond a shadow of doubt, anthropogenically caused climate change is occurring. Â However, we do the public no favors by posting graphs with uncited sources and complete transparency about sources and data. Below I provide 15 graphs of climate change providing their sources. Â Overwhelming they portray an alarming picture of changes on our planet. Â I chose only graphs that depict current or past changes. Â I specifically excluded projections and focused on patterns where the climate change link is...

The investigators include Brazilian researchers affiliated with the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP) and the University of Campinas (UNICAMP). "After the Big Bang, for every particle of matter an antiparticle was created. In particle physics, a very important question is whether all the laws of physics display a specific kind of symmetry known as CPT, and these measurements suggest that there is indeed a fundamental symmetry between nuclei and antinuclei," said Marcelo Gameiro...

Based on calculations of the pair's mass--together, and relative to each other--the researchers go on to predict a smashup 100,000 years from now, an impossibly long time to humans but the blink of an eye to a star or black hole.
