The main goal is hiding its presence and avoid the eye of the system administrator. Rootkits usually consist of a set of tools, to manipulate the Linux kernel, alter output to the screen or avoid some software from doing its tasks. Nowadays rootkits are less popular than they were before. One of the reasons is the increased security in the Linux kernel, making it harder to circumvent some areas (like using some system calls). Still they occur, or in a slightly different form. For example backdoors are still very popular. Often the attacker doesn&#8217;t even need full root access to abuse a system for other purposes....

The so-called end-Permian mass extinction ­— or more commonly, the “Great Dying” — remains the most severe extinction event in Earth’s history. Scientists suspect that massive volcanic activity, in a large igneous province called the Siberian Traps, may have had a role in the global die-off, raising air and sea temperatures and releasing toxic amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere over a very short period of time.

>Recently, on Twitter and Facebook I noticed graphs of climate change and its impacts being posted.  These were often unaccompanied with data sources or links. A lot of misinformation occurs across the web in both denial and support of climate change. Beyond a shadow of doubt, anthropogenically caused climate change is occurring.  However, we do the public no favors by posting graphs with uncited sources and complete transparency about sources and data. Below I provide 15 graphs of climate change providing their sources.  Overwhelming they portray an alarming picture of changes on our planet.  I chose only graphs that depict current or past changes.  I specifically excluded projections and focused on patterns where the climate change link is...

Based on calculations of the pair's mass--together, and relative to each other--the researchers go on to predict a smashup 100,000 years from now, an impossibly long time to humans but the blink of an eye to a star or black hole.

Due largely to their random distribution across the surface, the science team concluded that the moon is shrinking. These small faults are typically less than 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) long and only tens of yards or meters high.
