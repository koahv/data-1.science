>Human activity almost killed this loggerhead sea turtle in Turkey, but a group of doctors and researchers are looking to right that wrong with a 3D-printed prosthetic. The turtle, which is marked as an endangered species, was struck by a boat propeller while swimming in its natural habitat. The accident shattered the animal's upper and lower jaw, leaving the turtle unable to eat on its own. That's when a group at Pamukkale University in Turkey decided to explore its options for healing the animal and bringing it back into the wild. They decided a 3D-printed replacement jaw was the best option. The team partnered with BTech, a Turkish biotechnology company specializing in 3D-printed prosthetics, and after two months of research an...

>Humans concerned about climate change are working to find ways of capturing excess carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and sequestering it in the Earth. But Nature has its own methods for the removal and long-term storage of carbon, including the world's river systems, which transport decaying organic material and eroded rock from land to the ocean....

>Click here to view the embedded video. When it comes to humanity’s impact on the planet, we just can’t seem to find the right balance. When one thing comes into balance, another gets thrown out of whack. In this case it looks like the ozone layer is finally starting to get fixed up while greenhouse gases are hitting dangerously high levels. According to Engadget and a paper from NASA’s Goddard Space Center, the ozone layer that protects us from the sun’s harmful rays is starting to heal. And at the same time, data from NOAA reveals that the global month average for airborne carbon dioxide is now 400 parts per million (ppm) – or 50 ppm beyond the United Nation’s “safe limit” for atmospheric carbon.

The results, published today (7 May) in the journal Current Biology, identify a key point in the evolutionary transition from soft to hard bodies in early ancestors of arthropods, the group that contains modern insects, crustaceans and spiders. The study looked at two types of arthropod ancestors - a soft-bodied trilobite and a bizarre creature resembling a submarine. It found that a hard plate, called the anterior sclerite, and eye-like features at the front of their bodies were connected through nerve traces origin...

>Image via NASA We know Enceledus has liquid water by its cryovolcanoes. There are other ways we can tell if a moon has a water interior, but one of the more interesting methods is to look at a moon’s aurora. This approach was recently used to show that Jupiter’s moon Ganymede has more liquid water than Earth. You might have seen an aurora on Earth when there has been a rise in solar activity. On Earth, the aurora (or northern lights) are caused by charged particles emitted by solar flares that interact with Earth’s magnetic field. When a charge enters Earth’s magnetic field, the magnetic field causes the charge to spiral along the magnetic field. For this reason magnetic fields tend to trap charges along their field lines. The charges gener...
