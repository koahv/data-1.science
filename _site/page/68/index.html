<p>During the middle of 2013, Jupiter’s moon Io came alive with volcanism. Now, an image from the Gemini Observatory captures what is one of the brightest volcanoes ever seen in our solar system. The image below, obtained on August 29, 2013, reveals the magnitude of the eruption that was the “grand finale” in a series of eruptions on the distant moon. Io’s volcanism is caused by the tidal push-and-pull of massive Jupiter, which heats the satellite’s interior – making it our Solar System’s most volcanically active known body.</p>

<p>Following its discovery by Galileo in January 1610, Io has been the focus of repeated telescopic and satellite scientific observation. These studies have shown that the orbital and gravitational relationships between Io, its sister moons Europa and Ganymede, and Jupiter cause massive, rapid flexing of its rocky crust. These tidal flexures generate tremendous heat within Io’s interior, which is released through the many surface volcanoes observed.
Io is extremely active, with literally hundreds of volcanic sources on its surface. Interestingly, although Io is so volcanically active, more than 25 times more volcanically active than Earth, most of the long-term surface changes resulting from volcanism are restricted to less than 15 percent of the surface, mostly in the form of changes in lava flow fields or within paterae.
According to University of California Berkeley (UCB) astronomer Katherine de Kleer, the Gemini observations, “… represent the best day-by-day coverage of such an eruption – thanks to Gemini’s rapid and flexible scheduling capabilities.” De Kleer, who led one of a pair of two papers published today in the journal Icarus, adds that the Gemini data allowed the team to monitor the evolution of the extreme volcanic activity over nearly the first two weeks of the eruption – which provided a critical new perspective on the outburst events.
The image of Io below was taken in the near-infrared with adaptive optics at the Gemini North telescope on August 29. In addition to the extremely bright eruption on the upper right limb of the satellite, the lava lake Loki is visible in the middle of Io’s disk, as well as the fading eruption that was detected earlier in the month by de Pater on the southern (bottom) limb. Io is about one arcsecond across.</p>

<p>De Kleer’s paper examines the powerful late-August eruption in detail, concluding that the energy emitted was about 20 Terawatts and expelled many cubic kilometers of lava. “At the time we observed the event, an area of newly-exposed lava on the order of tens of square kilometers was visible” says de Kleer. “We believe that it erupted in fountains from long fissures on Io’s surface, which were over ten-thousand-times more powerful than the lava fountains during the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajokull, Iceland, for example.”
“Everyone right away tends to categorically exclude the possibility of life on Io,” said astrobiologist Dirk Schulze-Makuch at Washington State University. Conditions on Io might have made it a friendlier habitat in the distant past. If life did ever develop on Io, there is a chance it might have survived to the present day, Schulze-Makuch suggested.
“Life on the surface is all but impossible, but if you go down further into the rocks, it could be intriguing,” he said. “We shouldn’t categorize it as dead right away just because it’s so extreme.”
Computer models suggest Io formed in a region around Jupiter where water ice was plentiful. Io’s heat, combined with the resulting possibility of liquid water, could have made life plausible.
“There must have been quite a lot of water on Io shortly after formation, judging from the amount of water ice on Europa and Ganymede,” said Schulze-Makuch.
Jupiter’s radiation would have stripped this water from Io’s surface, perhaps within 10 million years. At this point life could have retreated underground, where water might still be abundant, and geothermal activity and sulfur compounds could provide microbes with sufficient energy to survive.
Although no organic molecules have been detected on the moon’s surface, that does not mean they do not exist underground, Schulze-Makuch said. Any organic compounds that once existed on the surface or that may today still emanate from the subsurface – which probably were naturally present in this region of space during Io’s formation – would get quickly destroyed by Jupiter’s radiation.
The many lava tubes thought to exist on Io could serve as an especially favorable environment for life, Schulze-Makuch suggested, by protecting organisms from radiation. The lava tubes also could provide thermal insulation, trapping moisture and providing nutrients such as sulfurous compounds. Microbes are common in lava tubes on Earth, from ice and volcano zones in Iceland to hot sand-floored tubes in Saudi Arabia, and lava tubes are the most plausible cave environment for life on Mars, he added.
The primordial soup that any life on Io might have originated from was likely based on water, but the solvent of choice for organisms there might have drastically changed later on as the moon transformed. Hydrogen sulfide is one choice, as it is reasonably abundant in Io’s shallow subsurface and remains liquid from negative 123 to negative 76 degrees F (-86 to -60 degrees C), falling within the environmental conditions that would prevail there. While it is not especially efficient as a solvent for ions, it does dissolve many substances, including many organic compounds. Other possibilities include sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid.
“I’m exploring with colleagues whether sulfur compounds could work as solvents of life,” Schulze-Makuch noted. Given the wild extremes Io can swing through as it orbits Jupiter, one possible survival strategy for life in this challenging environment would be to remain dormant most of the time, only reverting back when nutrients were rich. “It’d be much easier for life to take a beating if it goes dormant regularly,” Schulze-Makuch said.
In addition to de Kleer and de Pater, the lead authors on the two publications discussing Io’s events, the research team included Máté Ádámkovics of UCB, Ashley Davies from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and David Ciardi of Caltech’s NASA Exoplanet Science Institute. The work is funded by the National Science Foundation and NASA’s Outer Planets Research and Planetary Geology and Geophysics Program.

<p>Question: How did the universe begin?
Asked by Nancy Cruz
 
Answer:
That’s a good question and the answer is a little unsatisfying. At the moment, we simply don’t know how the universe began. It’s important to note that a “big bang” did occur (and I stress the “a”). That much we know and are pretty comfortable about. What we don’t know is what caused the big bang, what the state of the universe was like during or right before the big bang event, and a few others. I’m going to (briefly) explain what we do know, the limitations with studying the big bang event itself, and some theories as to what caused it.
The Super Condensed History of the Universe</p>

<p>Artist’s impression of the early universe Credit: NASA/Adolf Schaller</p>

<p>I’m going to work backwards really quickly about everything we know. Galaxies, for the most part, started forming about 1 billion years after the big bang (13 billion years ago). On that, it’s important to note that some studies suggest galaxies started forming pretty much at the same time stars did, but that’s not important right now. The first stars started forming about 200 million years after the big bang. Continuing on our journey backwards in time, we have the universe’s dark ages, recombination, and matter domination dating back to about 70,000 years after the big bang. Nucleosynthesis took place 3 minutes and 20 seconds after the big bang, which is where all of the early elements formed. The photon, lepton, and Hadron epochs happen dating back to about 10^-6 seconds (the photon epoch is responsible for the creation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)).
The inflationary epoch happens before 10^-32 seconds, this is a big one because this ties into inflation theory which attempts to explain some of the anomalies we see in the universe. More on that later. Between 10^-43 seconds and 10^-36 we have grand unification, where all four fundamental forces of physics are unified as the electronuclear force. Both of these are two central observations of the big bang and we can’t explain either of them.
The Current Theory</p>

<p>The current theory for the big bang is depressingly incomplete. This is probably the theory you’re most familiar with. As it stands, most physicists believe there was a singularity that held the contents of everything we see. It’s often described as being infinitely dense and very hot. About 13.8 billion years ago, the singularity underwent an extremely rapid inflationary period and it “exploded”. In the wake of that explosion, the whole of space, time, and matter was created. The singularity didn’t explode into anything, the explosion caused everything to burst into existence.
The early universe was an extremely uncomfortable place to be. It was very turbulent; the inflationary period took the big bang event and ran with it (which explains the nearly uniform temperature seen in the CMB and why the universe didn’t immediately collapse into a black hole). From there, the laws of physics as we know and love them takes over and the rest is history (as validated mostly in the Large Hadron Collider).
The Problems</p>

<p>Image source</p>

<p> 
Our math breaks down when trying to describe the big bang singularity. We apply our equations and we get answers that don’t make sense. This is because we don’t have a grand unified theory that incorporates the four fundamental forces. We have relativity, a very good theory of gravity, and we have the standard model of particle physics, which is the unification of the electromagnetic, strong, and weak forces, but we don’t have a bridge between the two. This is severely limiting because, as it turns out, a lot of stuff happened between the Planck epoch (10^-43 seconds) and the Electroweak epoch (10^-36).
We don’t have any idea what caused the big bang, because we can’t mathematically probe the big bang singularity. We also don’t know what the nature of the singularity was like “before the big bang” (which some physicists, such as Lawrence Krauss, argues is a nonsensical question to ask since time was created in the big bang. Until we know more, the question “what happened before the big bang” can’t be answered and is impractical to ask). We don’t know what caused the inflationary epoch (though, we think the phase transition that brought the grand unification epoch to an end had something to do with it). We also don’t know why the inflationary epoch ended.
That’s a summary of the main big bang theory. It’s important to realize before I move into the alternate theories that all of these theories are alternates and many don’t have wide acceptance in the scientific community. The alternate theories attempt to answer some of these questions left behind from the standard big bang theory, but those theories don’t know any more than the standard big bang theory knows. Some of them are interesting, some of them make more sense, but we won’t know more until some smart chap figures out grand unified theory.
Alternate Theories: Fourth-Dimensional Black Hole</p>

<p>Image Credit: Credit: Victor De Schwanberg and Science Photo Library.</p>

<p>According to the research conducted by a team of theoretical physicists, it’s possible the universe exists on the event horizon of a fourth-dimensional black hole. The basic thinking is, if there is a fourth-dimensional bulk universe that has stars, and those stars behave like ours do, some of the larger ones could collapse to form black holes. When we look at black holes in our universe, the event horizon appears two-dimensional. It stands to reason that a fourth-dimensional back hole’s event horizon could appear three-dimensional and that region is where we find ourselves. This hypothesis, if proven, could more adequately explain the movements and patterns seen in our universe by modeling its motions on the surface of a fourth-dimensional event horizon. The hypothesis, however, fails to explain the temperature differences seen in the CMB. Since there are small but noticeable variations, that portion of the hypothesis needs to be revised before it’s viable. Read more about the theory here.
Alternate Theories: Space-Time-Mass Conversions</p>

<p>A depiction of a 3-sphere. Image from: Wikipedia</p>

<p>This is one of my favorite alternate theories from a theatrical “cool” perspective. This theory basically eliminates the whole idea of a big bang as we’ve traditionally thought of it. If our universe exists inside a 3-sphere (which is similar to a three-dimensional sphere but in a higher dimension) then this research claims the nature of the universe changes dramatically. From variable constants (like the speed of light and the gravitational constant) and reviving the idea of a “static state” universe, this hypothesis claims the universe is without a beginning or a defined end. Instead, as time progresses, length, mass, and time convert between one another, which causes the universe to contract and expand depending on the values. This daring hypothesis replaces a number of our fundamental concepts of the universe and eliminates all of the problems with the big bang model I mentioned before. Currently, the hypothesis is under review and, though it has a little observational evidence supporting it, the hypothesis has a long way to go before it’s an accepted theory. Read more about it here.
Alternate Theories: Cosmological Natural Selection
Cosmological natural selection takes the big bang idea one step further. This hypothesis suggests that the purpose of the universe is to create black holes. Black holes, in this case, act as a universe’s “offspring” and, naturally, the more offspring a universe has, the more viable it is. This theory is both an alternate to the big bang theory and the multiverse hypothesis in its attempt to explain why some of the constants we have appear so fine-tuned. This theory does provide falsifiable claims and it has held up to scrutiny in our observations of inflation and neutron stars. Read more about it here.</p>

<p>Image Source</p>

<p>I could list alternate theories until my fingers bleed and your eyes fall out of your head. Those are some of my favorites. Every proposed alternate theory to the big bang has some problems, or it hasn’t been tested to the same standards as the big bang. In order for a theory to replace our current standard big bang theory, it has to explain everything the big bang explains (and more accurately) and it has to have testable predictions that can hold up to scrutiny. Until then, we’re stuck with the standard big bang model. It’s very likely when we discover grand unified theory that we’ll be able to model the big bang event and settle many of these questions for good (but, I’m certain we’ll raise a lot more in the process).</p>

  <p>In the last ten years or so, a number of skulls of Indarctos, Agriotherium and Ursavus have been collected from the Late Miocene deposits in the Linxia Basin. Since so far no complete Ursavus skull has ever been found and reported, and a number of questions pertaining to the origin, phylogeny and classification of the Ursinae are quite dependent on a better understanding of ancestral ursid members, especially the genus Ursavus, a well preserved skull of Ursavus was chosen as the subject of the first of a series of papers dealing with these ursid skulls by Professor Qiu Zhanxiang and his colleagues from Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP), Chinese Academy of Sciences. The latest issue of Vertebrata PalAsiatica (Volume 52, Issue 3) published their research in the cover article.</p>

  <p>(PLOS) Spider silk is an impressive material; lightweight and stretchy yet stronger than steel. But the challenge that spiders face to produce this substance is even more formidable. Silk proteins, called spidroins, must convert from a soluble form to solid fibers at ambient temperatures, with water as a solvent, and at high speed. How do spiders achieve this astounding feat? New research shows how the silk formation process is regulated.</p>

The effects of exercise on blood sugar (glycaemic) control in individuals with type 2 diabetes are well documented but the optimal exercise intensity and type remains to be defined. Traditionally, high-intensity exercise has not been recommended for individuals with type 2 diabetes due to a fear of inducing injuries and discouraging patients from continuing with the exercise program.</p>

<p>The personal journeys of world-changing thinkers such as Leonardo Da Vinci are fascinating enough in their own right, but what happens when you track the paths of thousands of similarly influential individuals across space and time? A team of scientists have done exactly that, mapping the birthplaces and death sites of over 120,000 of history’s most celebrated intellectuals from the past 2,600 years. The resulting 5-minute-long video — while it focuses primarily on the travels of European and American men — offers a great look at how human migration patterns shifted along with technology, and reinforces the enduring popularity of cities as cultural destinations across time. It’s also got some surprises (guess which Southern state became…</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Answer:
This image only covers the 8 large planets in our solar system. So naturally, Pluto, Ceres, Eris, Makemake or Haumea (or any of the larger KBOs, for that matter) aren’t covered.
To answer that portion of your question, on average Pluto is about 39 times farther from the Sun than the Earth is. (Which would generally make it 3.67 billion miles [5.91 billion km] away from the sun, on average.) If you were standing on Pluto, the Sun would appear 1/39th (or 0.026 times) of the size we see here on Earth. At its closest, it is 2.75 billion miles (4.4 billion km) from the sun. Yet at its at its closest point and 4.53 billion miles (7.29 billion km) at it’s furthest. At such a vast distance, it would appear to be just another star. Albeit, an extremely bright one that would hurt your eyes if you looked at it directly.
As a side note, one should keep in mind that Pluto has an extremely elliptical orbit. Sometimes, it crosses into Neptune’s orbit and the Sun is actually closer to Pluto than to Neptune! (This actually occurs some 20 years out of each 247.68 year orbit, which is pretty insignificant, but still cool never-the-less.)
To avoid any confusion, the little spaceship seen in each frame is irrelevant to the message. I believe the original designer put them there to help establish how much light the sun generates on each planet. (Each comparison was based on the approximate apparent visual magnitude of the sun for each planet)</p>

  <p>Security Program: Implementing Linux Security
With a proper security program, the security of Linux based systems can be greatly improved. In this article we have a look at how to prepare change properly. This way we can increase the chance to succeed with the security program.
Change Management
Almost everything is changing continuously, which is especially true in IT environments. Companies using ITIL have a process in place, named Change Management. Even if there is no formal process, changes in organizations should be properly prepared. Sure, things can change by just doing so, but usually the end goal may not be achieved. By focusing on the key elements of changing to achieve our preferred new situation, we increase the succeed ratio tremendously.
There are 4 key elements to achieve a change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Need for change
Vision
Resources for improvement
Plan and first steps</p>

<ol>
  <li>Need for change
While it might be obvious for some people that something have to be changed, it is often unclear why the change has to occur. Other people might have to be sold on the idea of the change. Only when having all key people on-board, chances to succeed are much higher.
Additionally the need for change consists of some pressure. For example regarding time. There should be some sense of urgency, or else people won’t start moving.
Reasons for implementing security activities like system hardening or regular security audits, might be for compliance.
Define the need to change with lessons from the past, like:</li>
</ol>

<p>Any intrusion / break-in
Lack of trust by customers
Requests from customers for compliance</p>

<ol>
  <li>Vision
Before trying to change something, get a clear image on what the outcome should be. Vision is needed to get closer to this outcome. Usually it consists of a set of insights, knowledge and decision making. Know your market, environment, company and people.
Also in information security we should have a clear vision in why we are here and what we try to achieve. When implementing Linux security in your environment, especially if it currently is based on ad hoc activities, take a few steps back first. Define the outcome, the possible constraints and the key people involved. Write down who is opposite of such change and who might be more than an enabler of the security program.
For the Linux security program, make sure to know at least these areas:</li>
</ol>

<p>Used Linux/Unix versions (e.g. Red Hat, Solaris, mixed)
Available budget
Available resources
Deadlines</p>

<ol>
  <li>Resources
Nothing can be changed without resources. This includes the appropriate tooling for example. Sometimes existing tools might be used, or build upon tool kits and processes.
Besides tooling there is people and their knowledge. Does the company have enough in-house knowledge, or should an external consultant assist? Even if you have the knowledge, are these people available for side projects?
Then there is time, deadlines and the related pressure. Make sure there is enough time, or at least enough people to help completing tasks. Time killers include company politics, badly prepared meetings and distractions. Especially people working on projects to enable the change to happen, should not be distracted with (too much) operational tasks.
Required information:</li>
</ol>

<p>Which people are active in project
Who has a need to know
Are there are any deadlines
Compliance applicable (SOx, PCI etc)</p>

<ol>
  <li>Plan
While actual change is especially visible in the execution, it is the planning upfront which makes the transition much smoother. Know possible threats, include what people need extra convincing, or what communication needs to happen.
Try to have a detailed plan upfront, so it is clear what needs to be done at what stage. Including communication, meetings and approvals (e.g. a moment for a go / no-go).
Tools to use:</li>
</ol>

<p>Templates
Progress sheets
Change Management (ITIL)
Spreadsheet and databases (e.g. CMDB)</p>

<p>The outcome of using the right tools and the invested preparation, should be a clear plan with all activities includes. When it is time to start working on the first activities, the plan should be guidance for involved people.
Dealing with exceptions
Most projects will have sooner or later an exceptional event. Simple events like missing a deadline, due to a third party not fulfilling its promises for delivery. Other exceptions may include technical difficulties during implementation. With a clear plan, the amount of bad surprises should be limited. However if people know how they can report any inconsistencies, project risks can be decreased. Anything reported exceptions can be handled on a case-by-case basis. Determine upfront who has authority to collect exceptions and who is authorized take action or make a decision.
Program or Projects?
Implementing security on Linux based systems can be a very time consuming project. Therefore it might be better to embed it into a program, with many smaller projects.
Each project will then have a clear scope, time constraints and dedicated resources assigned. The big benefit is that change is directly visible, as now projects might just take a few hours (instead of days or weeks).
Core (Linux kernel)
With Linux being the core of the operating itself, it makes it the right location to start with. Determine what Linux kernel versions are being used within your environment. Determine what actions already have been taken to secure the kernel and the related components. This might include the way data is stored on the system (what file system is used?). What options are used to fortify the core of the operating system.
Determine the version of the used Linux kernels might give a great insight in software patch management. If old kernels are being used, chances are high that the system is vulnerable to attacks via the network, or locally. Usually exploiting tools being quickly available to abuse these weaknesses. This makes it important to start protecting the system from the inside out and patch management is one first step.
Software
There are two fundamental things when securing a system when it comes to software:</p>

<p>Use of what software components
Software and security patch management</p>

<p>While this document is not meant as a system hardening guide, the first piece is important to keep systems clean. Do not install tools which are not needed. Besides the additional space, it might give access to data in unexpected ways. In the worst case you might be even running an unused but vulnerable application!
Regarding software patch management you should define a clear plan on how to embed proper software and security patching. How are you going to deal with software updates and how with security updates in particular. Do they follow the same schedule, or are security patches given priority to limit the exposure of weaknesses? Depending on your organization and security policy, this might totally depend.
Networking
From a networking level things have become more interesting over the last years. Every system nowadays is interconnected, up to our mobile phones. Protecting the network stack is therefore an important part in securing systems.
One of the things for a security program could be the implementation of a firewall. Even if you already have a network firewall, the presence of a local firewall might have benefits. This is especially the case when having systems of multiple customers in the same VLANs, or accessible via the internet.
Users
Last, but definitely not least, is dealing with users. Not the people itself, but dealing with the AAA part of it:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Authentication
How are users connecting to the system and what kind of authentication controls might they use (password, smart card, token). Closely related are the implementation of password controls, defining the security and strength of these controls.</li>
  <li>Authorization
After a user is successfully authenticated, we should know what each user is supposed to do on a system. This involves in determining what a user could access, in what groups it should be in and the related file system permissions. One of a common type of authorization control is the usage of sudo. If a “normal” user needs temporary privileged permissions, you do not want to hand them the root password. Properly implementing sudo gives users the possibility to do their work, while keeping the root password secret.</li>
  <li>Accounting
For controlling our security, we should know upfront what a user is supposed to do. However, you might want to monitor behavior on the system for security reasons as well. Other reasons might be troubleshooting or debugging. In any case, tracking access and executed commands might be useful.
Safeguarding of Changes
Changing an environment, including Linux systems might be easy. However we should keep in mind the goal of the program and the related projects. Each change should be properly documented, approved and executed.
After each change has been done, documentation should be updated, so operational staff is aware of the change and use the right work instructions. Additionally, the system and change should be protected against other changes (e.g. undoing previous work). By properly monitoring the recently made change, we can control the improvements and make sure they stay in place.
 
With all tips in this document given, good luck with your security program! If you need additional guidance or tips for your program, contact us via the About page.
