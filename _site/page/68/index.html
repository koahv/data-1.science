>Dark matter is a mysterious type of matter that doesn't interact with any form of electromagnetic radiation, i.e., light. It doesn’t radiate light, and light doesn’t bounce off it. Although we’ve never detected dark matter directly, a large amount of evidence points to its existence.Evidence for Dark MatterFritz Zwicky first proposed the idea in the 1930s, when he was observing the nearby and populous Coma galaxy cluster. By observing the light these galaxies emitted, Zwicky estimated the total mass of the cluster. But when he measured the galaxies’ velocities, Zwicky discovered that they were moving so fast that the cluster should have been breaking apart: the gravitational pull of its mass was too small in comparison.It seemed unlikely th...

>Vesto Slipher’s observations of spiral nebulae in the early 20th century led him to conclude that most spirals, with the exception of a few (such as Andromeda), were receding from Earth. Edwin Hubble confirmed that the spiral nebulae were actually separate galaxies in 1925 when he discovered Cepheid variable stars in Andromeda. These pulsating stars obey a period-luminosity law—essentially, the longer the period of light variation, the brighter the star—which makes it possible to determine their distances. Hubble found that Andromeda was much too distant to be part of our galaxy, confirming what other astronomers previously suspected: the spiral nebulae were actually separate galaxies.Using data from Slipher and others, <a href="http://www....

>(Phys.org) —An international research team, led by Dr. Yuji Harada from Planetary Science Institute, China University of Geosciences, has found that there is an extremely soft layer deep inside the Moon and that heat is effectively generated in the layer by the gravity of the Earth. These results were derived by comparing the deformation of the Moon as precisely measured by Kaguya (SELENE, Selenological and Engineering Explorer) and other probes with theoretically calculated estimates. These findings suggest that the interior of the Moon has not yet cooled and hardened, and also that it is still being warmed by the effect of the Earth on the Moon. This research provides a chance to reconsider how both the Earth and the Moon have been evolvi...

>   During the middle of 2013, Jupiter’s moon Io came alive with volcanism. Now, an image from the Gemini Observatory captures what is one of the brightest volcanoes ever seen in our solar system. The image below, obtained on August 29, 2013, reveals the magnitude of the eruption that was the “grand finale” in a series of eruptions on the distant moon. Io’s volcanism is caused by the tidal push-and-pull of massive Jupiter, which heats the satellite’s interior – making it our Solar System’s most volcanically active known body.  Following its discovery by Galileo in January 1610, Io has been the focus of repeated telescopic and satellite scientific observation. These studies have shown that the orbital and gravitational relationships betwe...

>&nbsp; Image Credit: Stock.xchng Question: How did the universe begin? Asked by Nancy Cruz   Answer: That&#8217;s a good question and the answer is a little unsatisfying. At the moment, we simply don&#8217;t know how the universe began. It&#8217;s important to note that a &#8220;big bang&#8221; did occur (and I stress the &#8220;a&#8221;). That much we know and are pretty comfortable about. What we don&#8217;t know is what caused the big bang, what the state of the universe was like during or right before the big bang event, and a few others. I&#8217;m going to (briefly) explain what we do know, the limitations with studying the big bang event itself, and some theories as to what caused it.
