>Researchers at UC Berkeley managed to generate the map with the help of a US department of energy supercomputer, showing how the hot molten rock doesn’t rise up in a straight line. Also, the base of the island may not be directly beneath it. Rather, the plumes – which are 400-degrees hotter than surrounding rock, and are far wider below the surface than geophysicists had presumed – rise haphazardly and then widen as they get to the surface. The latter aspect is what shapes volcanic islands, like Hawaii, with the lower rock often not directly connected to what we consider islands, thanks to a meandering rise. The research actually shows two huge, 5,000km-across “blobs” of hot rock, directly opposite each other under Africa and the Pacific O...

>The open source map project published in Nature this week shows us that neutrinos and antineutrinos are everywhere around us, and don’t just come from sun rays and nuclear reactors, but can be detected within the Earth, its atmosphere and, of course, across the cosmos. The neutrino was theorised by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930 to explain the continuous energy spectrum of nuclear beta rays. Further research by Enrico Fermi around the time of the Manhattan Project in the 1940s produced a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction caused by antineutrinos, antimatter cousins to neutrinos and the smallest particles known to science. The scientists conclude that the level of interactions between these particles means that the Earth is pretty much a “neutri...

But now, a team from Yale University has gone to great lengths to combine data from satellite imagery, forest inventories and supercomputer-powered calculations to estimate the amount of trees at a square-kilometre level. Publishing its results in Nature, the three trillion trees figure that has been generated has shown that since the start of major human civilisation the planet’s tree population has plummeted by almost half (46pc). Using the current number, this amount would equate to 422 trees to every person on Earth....

Excavating at the Pit of Bones began systematically in 1984, but it was not until 1991 when the greatest accumulation of human fossils were found; an absolute scientific treasure older than 400,000 years from the Middle Pleistocene. Now, this impressive array of fossils has allowed scientists for the first time to very precisely describe the morphological characteristics of the individuals discovered.  Over 1500 Fossils Analyzed The study, which has involved a dozen experts from different institutions, has analyzed fossils f...

The typical human body is an assembly of some 37 trillion cells, and each holds all the information needed to make a complete human being. Our DNA, the double-stranded helix responsible for heredity, contains 3 billion letters that dictate everything from hair and skin color to blood type. In fact, DNA is the most important identity document we will ever carry. Besides random mutations and damage, it doesn’t change from the day we’re born. But that paradigm may soon start to shift.
