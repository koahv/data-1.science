  <p>Once again, the findings of the now famous Pit of Bones, one of the most important sites in the Sierra de Atapuerca (Burgos, Spain), seems to “force us to revolutionize” human evolution as we have understood it so far.
Excavating at the Pit of Bones began systematically in 1984, but it was not until 1991 when the greatest accumulation of human fossils were found; an absolute scientific treasure older than 400,000 years from the Middle Pleistocene. Now, this impressive array of fossils has allowed scientists for the first time to very precisely describe the morphological characteristics of the individuals discovered. 
Over 1500 Fossils Analyzed
The study, which has involved a dozen experts from different institutions, has analyzed fossils from over 1,500 skeletons - from the neck down- of the more than 6,700 fossils uncovered from the Pit of Bones. They state that the fossils belong to at least 28 individuals of both sexes and various ages.Read moreSection: NewsEvolution &amp; Human Origins</p>

What did the universe look like shortly after it came into being? The ALICE experiment (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) at CERN in Switzerland concerns itself with this question. At the largest particle accelerator in the world, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), researchers let lead nuclei and protons collide at the highest beam energies to date. The temperatures thereby created are 100,000 times higher than those in the center of the Sun.
“A state is created that is very similar to the one after the Big Bang,” explains Laura Fabbietti, Professor in the Physics Department. She and Dr. Torsten Dahms head the two experimental ALICE groups at the TU Munich.
The so-called quark-gluon-plasma (QGP) probably formed one microsecond after the Big Bang, a point in time when the universe was expanding at great speed. The QGP produced in the laboratory is stable only for a fraction of a second, but, during this very short time, the researchers have the opportunity to look back into the past of the universe.
Furthermore, the ALICE experiment makes it possible to get to the bottom of one of mankind’s biggest mysteries. According to the CPT theorem (charge, parity, time), there is a fundamental symmetry between particles and antiparticles in our Universe. Specifically, there should be no difference between our Universe and one where all particles are exchanged with antiparticles (and vice versa), if the Universe is also inverted in time and space.
There must be a difference nevertheless, because the theory says that equal quantities of matter and antimatter should have been produced during the Big Bang. When particles and antiparticles meet, they annihilate each another. However, nowadays we almost only observe particles - there must therefore have been an imbalance.
Physicists are looking for a violation of the CPT theorem which would help to explain the existing matter-antimatter asymmetry. “ALICE is attempting to find a difference by means of high-precision measurements of the properties of particles and their antiparticles which are produced in particle collisions at the LHC,” explains Dahms.
In the current study, the researchers investigated the mass-to-charge ratio of helium-3 nuclei and deuterium nuclei and their respective antiparticles. Charge and mass are determined by measuring the particle traces and the particle’s specific energy loss within a gas detector called the TPC (Time Projection Chamber). The TCP is thus the heart of the ALICE detector system. The results published in “Nature Physics” are the most accurate measurements to date in this field and at the moment confirm the CPT theorem.
The researchers are currently working on improvements to the ALICE detectors with the aim of making the investigations even more precise. “At the moment we are able to record 500 collisions per second,” explains Fabbietti. “Soon it should be 50,000 collisions per second.” The TUM groups are working on an upgrade of the TPC read out. The existing multi-wire chambers are being replaced by state of the art GEM foils that provide better spatial resolution as well. The TUM group heads the GEM-TPC upgrade project for ALICE as part of an international collaboration. The installation of the new detectors is planned for 2018.

The image at the top of the page shows the cosmic microwave background (CMB), discovered accidentally in 1964 by Penzias and Wilson (Nobel Prize, 1978), the CMB is a remnant of the hot, dense phase of the universe that followed the Big Bang. For several hundred thousand years after the Big Bang, the universe was hot enough for its matter (predominantly hydrogen) to remain ionized, and therefore opaque (like the bulk of the sun) to radiation. During this period, matter and light were in thermal equilibrium and the radiation is therefore expected to obey the classic blackbody laws (Planck, Wien, Stefan).
The existence of the CMB is regarded as one of three experimental pillars that point to a Big Bang start to the universe. (The other two pieces of evidence that indicate that our universe began with a Bang are the linearity of the Hubble expansion law and the universal cosmic abundances of the light element isotopes, such as helium, deuterium, and lithium.)

<p>At the most fundamental level, we are all code. The typical human body is an assembly of some 37 trillion cells, and each holds all the information needed to make a complete human being.</p>

<p>Our DNA, the double-stranded helix responsible for heredity, contains 3 billion letters that dictate everything from hair and skin color to blood type. In fact, DNA is the most important identity document we will ever carry. Besides random mutations and damage, it doesn’t change from the day we’re born.</p>

<p>But that paradigm may soon start to shift. Scientists around the world have been experimenting with a powerful new tool called the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which has begun to open up the possibility of rewriting faulty or unwanted human, animal and plant DNA.</p>

<p>“We now have a way of easily making changes directly to the genome,” says Anja Smith, the research and development director at Dharmacon, a unit of GE Healthcare Life Sciences developing technologies for gene expression and editing, including CRISPR-Cas9. “You can now go directly into the cell itself and make changes to genes.”Top image: A DNA illustration.

<p>A Revolution in the making</p>

<p>Genetic engineering has advanced rapidly since the 1970s, when scientists first combined snips of DNA from one bacterium or virus with another. The genetic blueprints for life are almost entirely written in a seemingly simple language whose alphabet has just four letters, which stand for four different molecules called nucleic acids: A for adenine, C for cytosine, G for guanine and T for thymine.</p>

<p>Sequences of these letters spell out what we call genes, the basic units for inherited traits like blue eyes or the blood disorder hemophilia.</p>

<p>The ability to start reading that code, called DNA sequencing, took off in the 1970s and began accelerating in the 1980s. By 2003, scientists from the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the private firm Celera Genomics announced they had sequenced the first essentially complete human genome.</p>

<p>If genetic engineering were a race, everything that preceded decoding the human genome was only a trip to the starting line.</p>

<p>After that, the tempo picked up quickly. There was the phenomenal discovery that allowed scientists to effectively stop genes from working, a process called RNA interference. This allowed researchers to start silencing targeted genes, turning them off to see what would happen and learn what they do. That led to a torrent of findings that started to reveal exactly which genes are associated with disorders ranging from cancers to neurodegenerative diseases. The technique won its discoverers, Andrew Fire and Craig Mello, a Nobel Prize in 2006.</p>

<p>Along the way, researchers also began refining the difficult technique of inserting foreign DNA sequences into host genomes, getting the host cell to follow the foreign instructions and produce entirely foreign proteins. The finding allowed biopharmaceutical companies to create bacteria that could mass-produce the hormone insulin outside the human body.</p>

<p>In 2012, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna revealed the CRISPR-CAS9 system, which allows researchers to go deeper and precisely edit and fix individual genes. Their groundbreaking work has triggered the next revolution in genetic engineering.An image of a bacteria. Image credit: Getty Images</p>

<p>A tailor with a pair of scissors, sewing needle and thread</p>

<p>In the early 2000s, biologists realized that bacteria and their microscopic cousins, archaea, had short sequences of letters that showed up over and over again in their own DNA. These came to be known as “clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats,” or CRISPRs.</p>

<p>It turned out that the sequence of letters between these CRISPRs were actually parts of foreign DNA from viruses, which had previously attacked the bacterium. After defeating the virus, the bacterium incorporated a piece of the invading DNA into its own to recognize the next time it was under attack.</p>

<p>This bacterial acquired immunity defense system was a clever cut-and-paste job. The scissors were the bacterium’s DNA-cutting protein called Cas9. The pasted bit included DNA information identifying the virus.</p>

<p>Scientists figured they could use this same system to target specific parts of any DNA to cut and splice in new sequences at precise locations. They’ve also learned how to use the system to silence genes, activate silenced genes, and to add in sequences for whole new functions.</p>

<p>So far, CRISPR-Cas9 has proven to be extremely versatile, effectively targeting, cutting and editing DNA in human cancer and stem cells, yeast, fish, rabbits, wheat, and other organisms.  “If you design an RNA sequence that’s 20 letters long that corresponds to the part of the DNA you want to edit, you can direct the CRISPR-Cas9 system to make a double-strand break anywhere in DNA,” Smith says. “It’s an easy way to knock out genes to help understand what they do, but it also allows an easy way to create insertions that are very precise and could be used to treat disease. This discovery has totally reinvigorated the potential of gene therapy, and somebody is going to win a Nobel Prize for it.”&gt;DNA base pairs: Millions of pairs of just four nucleic acids- Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine and Thymine - form the DNA. Image credit: Getty Images</p>

<p>The gene-editing technology is still being developed and businesses like Dharmacon are helping speed up the research process. The GE unit has recently released a product called Edit-R  - editor, get it? - which drops from weeks to days the time it takes to build the genetic sequence the system uses to guide the Cas9 cutting protein to the exact spot along the target DNA. “We’re removing the steps that are required to save researchers time,” Smith says. “Edit-R is also more amenable to higher-throughput testing, which can be used to screen hundreds or thousands of genes at a time for biomedical research.”</p>

<p>Smith says rapid and accurate editing of genes opens up all sorts of research opportunities, from creating disease mutations for study to routes for new therapies against cancers, immune diseases and other ailments.</p>

<p>This gene-editing tool isn’t just expected to be useful against human disease; researchers plan to use it for improving crops and livestock and potentially even for projects like mosquito control. Revolutionary though CRISPR-Cas9 may be, such a powerful instrument to delete, insert or edit genes also comes with big ethical questions that are still being argued.</p>

<p>In April, Chinese scientists announced they had used the system to genetically alter human embryos for the first time. The revelation set off vigorous debate in scientific circles and among the general public. Should such powerful scientific tools be used to alter the DNA of a human before they are even born? If so, should that engineering be limited to fixing genetic mistakes that will lead to serious or fatal disorder, or can it be also used to augment people to have preferred traits?</p>

<p>Such concerns are still a ways off, but the case of the Chinese research is just the first in what will surely be more difficult questions now that genetic engineering is starting to look more like programming computer code.</p>

<p>“People are being very cautious about this,” Smith says. “It’s warranted. This is very new technology and we aren’t necessarily sure what editing one part of the DNA will do in another part of the cell. You’re targeting gene X, but are you accidentally also targeting gene Y and Z? The answer to this is still unknown.”</p>

  <p>Archaeologists in Spain have made a number of discoveries inside an ancient cave in Catalonia which suggest that Neanderthals had hot water and separate living quarters around 60,000 years ago.  The finding adds to the mounting evidence that Neanderthals were a lot more sophisticated than previously thought and were at least as advanced, if not more so, than early Homo sapiens.
The Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution(IPHES) reports that more than 10,000 fossil remains and artifacts were retrieved from the cave located at Abric Romaní in Catalonia, enabling scientists to confirm long-term occupation of the site by Neanderthals. 
Among the more significant discoveries was a concave hole measuring 16 inches x 12 inches  x 4 inches (40 x 30 x 10cm), which was found enclosed by a large number of hearths with evidence of fire use. Archaeologists believe the Neanderthals used the hole to heat water by placing heated stones from the hearth.  Read moreSection: NewsEvolution &amp; Human Origins</p>

NASA has selected the potential next destination for the New Horizons mission to visit after its historic July 14 flyby of the Pluto system. The destination is a small Kuiper Belt object (KBO) known as 2014 MU69 that orbits nearly a billion miles beyond Pluto.
This remote KBO was one of two identified as potential destinations and the one recommended to NASA by the New Horizons team. Although NASA has selected 2014 MU69 as the target, as part of its normal review process the agency will conduct a detailed assessment before officially approving the mission extension to conduct additional science.
“Even as the New Horizon’s spacecraft speeds away from Pluto out into the Kuiper Belt, and the data from the exciting encounter with this new world is being streamed back to Earth, we are looking outward to the next destination for this intrepid explorer,” said John Grunsfeld, astronaut and chief of the NASA Science Mission Directorate at the agency headquarters in Washington. “While discussions whether to approve this extended mission will take place in the larger context of the planetary science portfolio, we expect it to be much less expensive than the prime mission while still providing new and exciting science.”
Like all NASA missions that have finished their main objective but seek to do more exploration, the New Horizons team must write a proposal to the agency to fund a KBO mission. That proposal – due in 2016 – will be evaluated by an independent team of experts before NASA can decide about the go-ahead.

Early target selection was important; the team needs to direct New Horizons toward the object this year in order to perform any extended mission with healthy fuel margins. New Horizons will perform a series of four maneuvers in late October and early November to set its course toward 2014 MU69 – nicknamed “PT1” (for “Potential Target 1”) – which it expects to reach on January 1, 2019. Any delays from those dates would cost precious fuel and add mission risk.
“2014 MU69 is a great choice because it is just the kind of ancient KBO, formed where it orbits now, that the Decadal Survey desired us to fly by,” said New Horizons Principal Investigator Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado. “Moreover, this KBO costs less fuel to reach [than other candidate targets], leaving more fuel for the flyby, for ancillary science, and greater fuel reserves to protect against the unforeseen.”
New Horizons was originally designed to fly beyond the Pluto system and explore additional Kuiper Belt objects. The spacecraft carries extra hydrazine fuel for a KBO flyby; its communications system is designed to work from far beyond Pluto; its power system is designed to operate for many more years; and its scientific instruments were designed to operate in light levels much lower than it will experience during the 2014 MU69 flyby.
The 2003 National Academy of Sciences’ Planetary Decadal Survey (“New Frontiers in the Solar System”) strongly recommended that the first mission to the Kuiper Belt include flybys of Pluto and small KBOs, in order to sample the diversity of objects in that previously unexplored region of the solar system. The identification of PT1, which is in a completely different class of KBO than Pluto, potentially allows New Horizons to satisfy those goals.
But finding a suitable KBO flyby target was no easy task. Starting a search in 2011 using some of the largest ground-based telescopes on Earth, the New Horizons team found several dozen KBOs, but none were reachable within the fuel supply aboard the spacecraft.
The powerful Hubble Space Telescope came to the rescue in summer 2014, discovering five objects, since narrowed to two, within New Horizons’ flight path. Scientists estimate that PT1 is just under 30 miles (about 45 kilometers) across; that’s more than 10 times larger and 1,000 times more massive than typical comets, like the one the Rosetta mission is now orbiting, but only about 0.5 to 1 percent of the size (and about 1/10,000th the mass) of Pluto. As such, PT1 is thought to be like the building blocks of Kuiper Belt planets such as Pluto.
Unlike asteroids, KBOs have been heated only slightly by the Sun, and are thought to represent a well preserved, deep-freeze sample of what the outer solar system was like following its birth 4.6 billion years ago.
“There’s so much that we can learn from close-up spacecraft observations that we’ll never learn from Earth, as the Pluto flyby demonstrated so spectacularly,” said New Horizons science team member John Spencer, also of SwRI. “The detailed images and other data that New Horizons could obtain from a KBO flyby will revolutionize our understanding of the Kuiper Belt and KBOs.” The New Horizons spacecraft – currently 3 billion miles [4.9 billion kilometers] from Earth – is just starting to transmit the bulk of the images and other data, stored on its digital recorders, from its historic July encounter with the Pluto system. The spacecraft is healthy and operating normally.
New Horizons is part of NASA’s New Frontiers Program, managed by the agency’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., designed, built, and operates the New Horizons spacecraft and manages the mission for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. SwRI leads the science mission, payload operations, and encounter science planning.

In a staggering find, scientists recently announced that the quasar closest to Earth is powered by two, not one, supermassive black holes.
The quasar in question lives in a galaxy dubbed Markarian 231 (Mrk 231). And although Mrk231 is the closest galaxy to Earth that hosts a known quasar, it is still rather far away, orbiting through the cosmos some 600 million light-years from our solar system.
Quasars, or “quasi-stellar radio sources” are the brightest and most distant star-like objects in the known universe. In fact, they are so bright, and they emit so much energy, some of them are believed to be producing 10 to 100 times more energy than the entire Milky Way Galaxy, and they do so in an area that’s comparable to the size of our solar system.
Imagine the energy of an entire galaxy squeezed down to a size that is equivalent to our Sun’s sphere of influence, and you will begin to understand the amazing power of a quasar.

Now, it’s generally agreed upon that quasars are produced by supermassive black holes consuming matter (perhaps devouring the equivalent mass of ten suns per year?) in an accretion disk. As the matter spins faster and faster, it heats up. Thus, giving off massive amounts of light and other forms of radiation such as x-rays, light rays, gamma rays and radio waves. This is essentially what we believe quasars are.
However, their exact mechanisms aren’t fully understood (aka, we don’t know exactly what they are).
As such, the discovery of these two black holes, which are furiously whirling about one another, indicates that, perhaps, most quasars host two central supermassive black holes. “The structure of our universe, such as those giant galaxies and clusters of galaxies, grows by merging smaller systems into larger ones, and binary black holes are natural consequences of these mergers of galaxies,” said co-investigator Xinyu Dai of the University of Oklahoma.
Thus, it is believed that these amazingly powerful objects come to orbit each other as a result of the most cataclysmic events in the known universe—galactic mergers.
Although such mergers rarely result in stellar collisions, as stars are amazingly far from one another, analyses suggest that the supermassive black holes that are generally found in the center of galaxies slowly come together as galaxies collide.
The result of such a merger?
Thanks to this research, we now have a better idea. It seems that, as they spiral in, the black-hole duo creates a tremendous amounts of energy. Ultimately, the amount of energy that is produced is so great, the core of the galaxy outshines the rest of the galaxy, meaning that this small region of space is brighter than the billions and billions of stars that makeup the rest of the galaxy, and it is this staggering amount of energy that we define as “quasars.”
In other words, black hole duos might be the mechanisms behind quasars a majority of the time.
The results were published in the August 14, 2015 edition of The Astrophysical Journal.
In order to uncover this find, scientists looked at Hubble archival observations of ultraviolet radiation emitted from the center of Mrk 231. If only one black hole were present in the center of the quasar, the whole accretion disk (the whirlpool of superheated gas that surrounds the black hole) would glow in ultraviolet rays. However, when scientists look at this area, they see that the ultraviolet glow abruptly ends near the central region. As such, we have observational evidence that there is a large hole surrounding the black hole.
The best explanation for this observation is that there are two black holes orbiting each other. To break this down a bit, scientists assert that the most likely solution is that there is a small black hole in orbit on the inner edge of the larger black hole’s accretion disk.
Of course, “small” is a relative term. The black hole that is in orbit is estimated to be 4 million solar masses and seems to have an orbital period of about 1.2 Earth-years. The central black hole is a rather hefty 150 million solar masses.
The binary black holes are predicted to spiral together and collide within a few hundred thousand years, which will, with any luck, provide an amazing show for any life that is still hanging about on our little planet.

A team of international scientists has shown for the first time that galaxies can change their structure over the course of their lifetime. By observing the sky as it is today, and peering back in time using the Hubble and Herschel telescopes, the team have shown that a large proportion of galaxies have undergone a major ‘metamorphosis’ since they were initially formed after the Big Bang.
By providing the first direct evidence of the extent of this transformation, the team hope to shed light on the processes that caused these dramatic changes, and therefore gain a greater understanding of the appearance and properties of the Universe as we know it today.
In their study, led by astronomers from Cardiff University’s School of Physics and Astronomy, which has been published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society¸ the researchers observed around 10,000 galaxies currently present in the Universe using a survey of the sky created by the Herschel ATLAS and GAMA projects.
The researchers then classified the galaxies into the two main types: flat, rotating, disc-shaped galaxies (much like our own galaxy, the Milky Way); and large, oval-shaped galaxies with a swarm of disordered stars.
Using the Hubble and Herschel telescopes, the researchers then looked further out into the Universe, and thus further back in time, to observe the galaxies that formed shortly after the Big Bang.
The researchers showed that 83 per cent of all the stars formed since the Big Bang were initially located in a disc-shaped galaxy. However, only 49 per cent of stars that exist in the Universe today are located in these disc-shaped galaxies–the remainder are located in oval-shaped galaxies.
The results suggest a massive transformation in which disc-shaped galaxies became oval-shaped galaxies.
A popular theory is that this transformation was caused by many cosmic catastrophes, in which two disk-dominated galaxies, straying too close to each other, were forced by gravity to merge into a single galaxy, with the merger destroying the disks and producing a huge pileup of stars. An opposing theory is that the transformation was a more gentle process, with stars formed in a disk gradually moving to the centre of a disk and producing a central pile-up of stars.
Lead author of the study Professor Steve Eales, from Cardiff University’s School of Physics and Astronomy, said: “Many people have claimed before that this metamorphosis has occurred, but by combining Herschel and Hubble, we have for the first time been able to accurately measure the extent of this transformation.
“Galaxies are the basic building blocks of the Universe, so this metamorphosis really does represent one of the most significant changes in its appearance and properties in the last 8 billion years.”
“This study is important as it establishes statistics showing that almost all stars formed in spiral galaxies in the past, but a large fraction of these now appear as large, dead, elliptical galaxies today,” saidAsantha Cooray, a co-author of the study from the University of California. “This study will require us to refine the models and computer simulations that attempt to explain how galaxies formed and behaved over the last 13 billion years.”
Dr David Clements, a co-author of the study from Imperial College London, said: “Up to now we’ve seen individual cases in the local universe where galaxy collisions convert spirals into ellipticals. This study shows that this kind of transformation is not exceptional, but is part of the normal history of galaxy evolution.”
Matthew Allen, a Ph.D. student at Cardiff University and a member of the team, said: “This is a huge step in understanding how the galactic population has evolved over billions of years. Using some of the most cutting edge data and techniques, we are finally beginning to understand the processes that have shaped our Universe.”
