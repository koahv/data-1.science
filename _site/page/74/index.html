>Down the rabbit hole in enchanting reimaginings. On July 4, 1862, English mathematician and logician Charles Dodgson boarded a small boat with a few friends. Among them was a little girl named Alice Liddell. To entertain her and her sisters as they floated down the river between Oxford and Godstow, Dodgson fancied a whimsical story, which he&#8217;d come to publish three years later under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. Alice in Wonderland went on to become one of the most beloved children&#8217;s books of all time, and my all-time favorite. In the century and a half since Sir John Tenniel&#8217;s original illustrations, the Carroll classic has sprouted everything from a pop-up book adaptation to a witty cookbook to a quantum physics allegory,...

>Scientists have identified the fossilized remains of an extinct giant bird that could be the biggest flying bird ever found. With an estimated 20-24-foot wingspan, the creature surpassed size estimates based on wing bones from the previous record holder—a long-extinct bird named Argentavis magnificens—and was twice as big as the Royal Albatross, the largest flying bird today. Scheduled to appear online the week of July 7, 2014, in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the findings show that the creature was an extremely efficient glider, with long slender wings that helped it stay aloft despite its enormous size....

Obviously, these senses aren&#8217;t unique to humans. In fact, over the years, we&#8217;ve found that creatures throughout the animal kingdom use very fascinating mechanisms to derive this same information. Granted, certain senses are more profound on other species (like sight, for instance. we know that many creatures can see in infrared), and many species have senses that work differently than ours do.

Plants are a key step in this plan. Firstly, plants have genetic material that can be damaged in the harsh environment of space in a similar manner to humans. Watching how plants survive and reproduce over a few generations could start revealing the potential problems of long term exposure to space. The moral of the story is, if we can send plants to the moon, and the plants survive, then we probably can survive too. This will also be some of...

I’m willing to bet that you have at least half a dozen objects in your immediate vicinity use electricity in some way to power its systems. Maybe you’re using a battery or you’re plugged directly into an outlet, but either way, this energy came to you via coal/wind/solar/geothermal or a host of other methods we use to generate power here on earth. Well, what about our spacecrafts? How do they get the power they need? It depends on where they are in the solar system. For spacecraft operating inside the inner solar system (including earth orbit), the traditional power source is solar. Solar panels (also called photovoltaics) convert light energy into us...

With power from a commercially available solar panel provided by utility company Public Service Electric and Gas (PSE&amp;G), researchers in the laboratory of Princeton professor of chemistry Andrew Bocarsly, working with researchers at New Jersey-based start-up Liquid Light Inc., converted CO2 and water to formic acid (HCOOH) in an electrochemical cell....

>When we think about our solar system, most of our mind&#8217;s likely wander to Jupiter&#8217;s immensely large storm, or Saturn&#8217;s fantastical rings. Perhaps some picture Neptune&#8217;s deep blue hue, or its sea of liquid diamond. The point being, these huge objects capture our imagination because they are so far-flung from Earthly sights, like the rolling seas of blue and green and the rocks that crunch beneath our shoes. We kind of take advantage of the fact that the vast majority of planets are composed almost entirely of gas; our solar system included.

Now, two years after making history by unearthing the Higgs boson, the particle that confers mass, physicists are broadening their probe into its identity, hoping this will also solve other great cosmic mysteries.

>At the very heart of quantum mechanics lies a monster waiting to consume unwary minds. This monster goes by the name The Nature of Reality™. The greatest of physicists have taken one look into its mouth, saw the size of its teeth, and were consumed. Niels Bohr denied the existence of the monster after he nonchalantly (and very quietly) exited the monster's lair muttering "shut up and calculate." Einstein caught a glimpse of the teeth and fainted. He was reportedly rescued by Erwin Schrödinger at great personal risk, but neither really recovered from their encounter with the beast. The upshot is that we had a group of physicists and philosophers who didn't believe that quantum mechanics represents reality but that it was all we co...

University of Pennsylvania astrophysicist, Bhuvnesh Jain, says the nature of gravity is the question of a lifetime. As scientists have been able to see farther and deeper into the universe, the laws of gravity have been revealed to be under the influence of an unexplained force. Two branches of theories have sprung up, each trying to fill its gaps in a different way. One branch — dark energy — suggests that the vacuum of space has an energy associated with it and that energy causes the observed acceleration. The other falls under the umbrella of “scalar-tensor” gravity theories, which effectively p...
