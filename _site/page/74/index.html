Now, two years after making history by unearthing the Higgs boson, the particle that confers mass, physicists are broadening their probe into its identity, hoping this will also solve other great cosmic mysteries. The better they become acquainted with the Higgs at the infinitely small quantum level, the further the experts seem from explaining certain cosmic-scale questions, like dark matter. "The observed characteristics of the Higgs boson, such as its mass, interaction strengths and life-time, provide very powerful co...

>At the very heart of quantum mechanics lies a monster waiting to consume unwary minds. This monster goes by the name The Nature of Reality™. The greatest of physicists have taken one look into its mouth, saw the size of its teeth, and were consumed. Niels Bohr denied the existence of the monster after he nonchalantly (and very quietly) exited the monster's lair muttering "shut up and calculate." Einstein caught a glimpse of the teeth and fainted. He was reportedly rescued by Erwin Schrödinger at great personal risk, but neither really recovered from their encounter with the beast. The upshot is that we had a group of physicists and philosophers who didn't believe that quantum mechanics represents reality but that it was all we co...

That's because people in many parts of the world do not have access to vitamin supplements. Select fruits and vegetables contain carotenoids such as beta-carotene, also known as "provitamin A."

University of Pennsylvania astrophysicist, Bhuvnesh Jain, says the nature of gravity is the question of a lifetime. As scientists have been able to see farther and deeper into the universe, the laws of gravity have been revealed to be under the influence of an unexplained force. Two branches of theories have sprung up, each trying to fill its gaps in a different way. One branch — dark energy — suggests that the vacuum of space has an energy associated with it and that energy causes the observed acceleration. The other falls under the umbrella of “scalar-tensor” gravity theories, which effectively p...

For instance, while kidneys can last around 24 hours, hearts and lungs have a survival time outside the body of around five hours. A team from the Centre for Engineering in Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital opted to trial a new preservation technique with livers, which tend to last around 12 hours after extraction.

#### Extract
>     Nearly 100 years since Albert Einstein developed general relativity, the theory has passed its toughest test yet in explaining the properties of observable Universe. Refuting recent cosmological speculation that gravity "is an illusion" (see below), the most precise measurements to date of the strength of gravitational interactions between distant galaxies show perfect consistency with general relativity’s predictions. Samushia and his colleagues analysed more than 600,000 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) Baryon Oscillations Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) catalogue to come up with a measurement of how much galaxies clump together within the vast volume that they occupy. "While the Cosmological Principle tells...
