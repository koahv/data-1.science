If an alien astromer was viewing Earth from space, could they tell that this planet is well-suited for life? Are there telltale signatures in the atmosphere or from our oceans? These are some of the questions that controllers of a lunar spacecraft sought to answer when it took a bit of a side mission. Instead of observing the Moon, NASA’s Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) briefly looked at Earth.
“The LCROSS spacecraft observed the Earth and made statements about ozone in Earth’s atmosphere and also liquid water,” said lead researcher Tyler Robinson, a postdoctoral researcher at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif. “We also used it to validate a tool to simulate how a distant Earth would appear.”
A paper on the research, “Detection of Ocean Glint and Ozone Absorption Using LCROSS Earth Observations,” is available now on the pre-publishing site Arxiv and has been accepted in the Astrophysical Journal.
LCROSS, which was smashed into the Moon as planned in 2009, had a primary mission to look for the signature of lunar water. About a decade before, NASA’s Lunar Prospector mission found hints of hydrogen in craters at the Moon’s poles. The divots are permanently shadowed from the heat of the Sun.
LCROSS was to follow up on those observations, and it repaid the investment in spades. It tracked what happened after its spent Centaur rocket stage crashed into the crater Cabeus near the Moon’s south pole, and found signs of hydrogen in spectroscopic measurements spanning infrared and ultraviolet light.
When LCROSS crashed into the moon itself, observations with NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and others revealed about 100 kilograms of water in the crater it punched in the regolith, which was about 20 meters (66 feet) across.
The spacecraft was indeed successful in finding (and helping other spacecraft find) water on the Moon. But could it also find water on our ocean-rich Earth at a distance? Scientists became curious about the prospect, especially after seeing that our oceans make a mirror-like reflection, called “glint,” when a distant Earth appears as a crescent from the perspective of the Moon.
The image at the top of the page shows the first flash of sunlight reflected off a lake on Saturn's moon Titan. The glint off a mirror-like surface is known as a specular reflection. It confirmed the presence of liquid in the moon's northern hemisphere, where lakes are more numerous and larger than those in the southern hemisphere.
LCROSS did three observation sessions of Earth in 2009. Interestingly, the spacecraft was not originally tasked to look at Earth as an exoplanet. Instead, scientists were evaluating how accurately the spacecraft was pointing after launch, said co-author and NASA astrophysicist Kimberly Ennico-Smith. The data was later repurposed for the exoplanet modeling used in this research.
“You never know what else another pair of eyes looking at data can bring you,” she wrote in an e-mail. “That’s why having and maintaining archives is so important.”
For example, finding hydroxyl — a type of water — on the Moon came from combining sets from India’s Chandryaan-1 lunar spacecraft, and NASA’s Cassini spacecraft on its way to Saturn. Both missions were using the Moon to calibrate their instruments; ocean examinations were not the main objective.
Looking at the repurposed data yielded a surprise. Not only did LCROSS see a glint, but it was a lot different than what researchers expected.
“The glint detection I found to be surprising for a couple of reasons,” Robinson said. “The spacecraft observation of glint was in disagreement with some previous observations that were done from the ground.”
Specifically, some researchers had tried to make predictions of the Earth’s glint based on gazing at the Moon. When looking at the Moon outside of full phase, it’s possible to see the Earth’s light shining faintly off of it in a phenomenon called “Earthshine.”
By comparing Earthshine data from a crescent-phase Earth with data from other phases, it’s possible to get measurements of how significant glint is in observations of Earth’s crescent sliver. These measurements predicted a much stronger glint than what Robinson’s team saw using the LCROSS data.
What also surprised researchers was how different the glint appeared in different wavelengths of light. At some wavelengths, glint dominated Earth’s appearance, while at other wavelengths, the glint effect was more muted, as it was masked by certain atmospheric phenomenon.
“Also, the Earth at crescent phase, thanks to the ocean, can be twice as bright. If it’s something you look for in exoplanets, it can be a significant effect,” added Robinson.
If over the course of several orbits, a planet is observed as more reflective at crescent phases and less reflective at other phases, then can it be assumed that ocean glint is the cause? Robinson cautions that the answer is not that simple.
“There could be other explanations,” he said. “Clouds have a tendency to reflect better at crescent phases than at other phases, and recent work has shown that, under some circumstances, the ice-covered polar regions can mimic certain glint effects.”
But there could be other indications of habitability and life as well. One thing they noticed from a distance was ozone, which was not as much of a surprise to scientists but still a useful tool for observations. Ozone especially showed up in ultraviolet light, and it could be a “bio-indicator,” or sign of life, on distant planets, Robinson said.
“Ozone is a key potential indicator of life, and it appears most strongly in ultraviolet observations of Earth,” he said. “So, future telescopes could look to the ultraviolet as a place to more easily detect biosignature gases.”
Such a telescope, however, will be a couple of decades down the line. While NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope will be an able planet-hunter, it will take the resolution of something like the cancelled NASA Terrestrial Planet Finder project to make better progress in searching these worlds, he said. There were a few different ideas for what it would look like, but one design had intended to combine four, 3.5-meter telescopes in space to look at parameters such as temperature and atmosphere, among others.
Another important aspect of the observations performed by LCROSS is that they become the basis for new telescope designs. NASA’s work allows researchers to gather data on which designs would best pick out certain features of planets, such as the reflectivity or ozone that LCROSS observed.
“It’s using current tools to predict and understand what future telescopes might one day see. By studying Earth now, you can ensure that we don’t accidentally engineer the telescope of the future and find out we didn’t build it strong enough,” Robinson said.

A fifth force may exist that disrupts the predictions general relativity makes outside our own galaxy, on cosmic-length scales. University of Pennsylvania astrophysicist, Bhuvnesh Jain, says the nature of gravity is the question of a lifetime. As scientists have been able to see farther and deeper into the universe, the laws of gravity have been revealed to be under the influence of an unexplained force.
Two branches of theories have sprung up, each trying to fill its gaps in a different way. One branch — dark energy — suggests that the vacuum of space has an energy associated with it and that energy causes the observed acceleration. The other falls under the umbrella of “scalar-tensor” gravity theories, which effectively posits a fifth force (beyond gravity, electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces) that alters gravity on cosmologically large scales.
“These two possibilities are both radical in their own way,” Jain said. “One is saying that general relativity is correct, but we have this strange new form of energy. The other is saying we don't have a new form of energy, but gravity is not described by general relativity everywhere.”
Jain’s research is focused on the latter possibility; he is attempting to characterize the properties of this fifth force that disrupts the predictions general relativity makes outside our own galaxy, on cosmic length scales.
By innovatively analyzing a well-studied class of stars in nearby galaxies, Jain and his colleagues — Vinu Vikram, Anna Cabre and Joseph Clampitt at Penn and Jeremy Sakstein at the University of Cambridge — have produced new findings that narrow down the possibilities of what this force could be. Their findings, published on the Arxiv (see below), are a vindication of Einstein’s theory of gravity.
Having survived a century of tests in the solar system, it has passed this new test in galaxies beyond our own as well.In 1998, astrophysicists made an observation that turned gravity on its ear: the universe’s rate of expansion is speeding up. If gravity acts the same everywhere, stars and galaxies propelled outward by the Big Bang should continuously slow down, like objects thrown from an explosion do here on Earth.
This observation used distant supernovae to show that the expansion of the universe was speeding up rather than slowing down. This indicated that something was missing from physicists’ understanding of how the universe responds to gravity, which is described by Einstein’s theory of general relativity.
Jain’s recent breakthrough came about when he and his colleagues realized they could use the troves of data on a special property of a common type of star as an exquisite test of gravity.
Astrophysicists have been pursuing tests of gravity in the cosmos for many years, but conventional tests require data on millions of galaxies. Future observations are expected to provide such enormous datasets in the coming data. But Jain and his colleagues were able to bypass the conventional approach.
“We’ve been able to perform a powerful test using just 25 nearby galaxies that is more than a hundred times more stringent than standard cosmological tests,” Jain said.The nearby galaxies are important because they contain stars called cepheids that are bright enough to be seen individually. Moreover, cepheids have been used for decades as a kind of interstellar yardstick because their brightness oscillates in a precise and predictable way.
“You can measure the brightness of a light bulb at some distance and know that, if you move it twice as far, it will be four times as faint. So you can tell just by the difference in its observed brightness how much further you moved it,” Jain said. “But you need to know how intrinsically bright the bulb is first to determine its actual distance from us.”
Cepheids have a unique trait that allows astrophysicists to get this critical information: their luminosity oscillates over the course of days and weeks. The known relationship between a cepheid’s rate of oscillation and intrinsic brightness serves as that baseline for calculating its distance from Earth, which in turn serves as a baseline for calculating the distance of other celestial objects.
The accelerating universe observation, for example, relied upon cepheid data for scale.“Now that we understand a little bit more about what makes the cepheids pulsate — a balance of gravity and pressure — we can use them to learn about gravity, not just distance,” Jain said. “If the fifth force enhances gravity even a little bit, it will make them pulsate faster.”
Because of their usefulness, there was already more than a decade of data on cepheids based on the Hubble Space Telescope and other large telescopes in Chile and Hawaii. Using that data, Jain and his colleagues compared nearly a thousand stars in 25 galaxies. This allowed them to make comparisons between galaxies that are theoretically “screened” or protected from the effects of the hypothetical fifth force and those that are not. Larger galaxies and ones that belong to galaxy clusters are screened, while smaller, isolated galaxies are not.
“If we compare galaxies that don't permit this extra force, like our own galaxy, with others that do, then we should see a difference in the way those galaxies’ cepheids behave,” Jain said. “Because this new force would increase the speed of their oscillations and because we can use the rate of their oscillations to their measure distance from us, the measurement we get from cepheids in unscreened galaxies should be smaller than distance measurements made with different techniques.”
Jain and his colleagues ultimately did not see variation between their control sample of screened galaxies and their test sample of unscreened ones. Their results line up exactly with the prediction of Einstein’s general relativity. This means that the potential range and strength of the fifth force is severely constrained.
“We find consistency with Einstein’s theory of gravity and we sharply narrow the space available to these other theories. Many of these theories are now ruled out by the data,” Jain said.With better data on nearby galaxies in the coming years, Jain expects that an entire class of gravity theories could essentially be eliminated. But there remains the exciting possibility that better data may reveal small deviations from Einstein’s gravity, one of the most famous scientific theories of all time.
The image at the top of the page shows the most distant X-ray cluster of galaxies yet found by astronomers using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. Approximately 10 billion light years from Earth, the cluster 3C294 is 40 percent farther than the next most distant X-ray galaxy cluster previously known. The existence of such a distant galaxy cluster is important for understanding how the Universe evolved.

Nearly 100 years since Albert Einstein developed general relativity, the theory has passed its toughest test yet in explaining the properties of observable Universe. Refuting recent cosmological speculation that gravity "is an illusion" (see below), the most precise measurements to date of the strength of gravitational interactions between distant galaxies show perfect consistency with general relativity’s predictions.
Samushia and his colleagues analysed more than 600,000 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) Baryon Oscillations Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) catalogue to come up with a measurement of how much galaxies clump together within the vast volume that they occupy.
"While the Cosmological Principle tells us that the Universe should have same properties in every direction, observations do not match this picture," explains Lado Samushia, of the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation at the University of Portsmouth. "Because galaxies are themselves parts of larger structures that are growing, they tend to 'infall' towards each other. This infall gives an apparent effect that we only see in the direction towards us, because of the way in which we observe the galaxies."
Using the observed distortions in galaxy positions, the team were able to measure the strength of gravity with a precision of 6 per cent, the strongest constraint of its kind as yet. The measurements turned out to be perfectly consistent with the predictions of Einstein’s general relativity theory.
More than 600 000 galaxies from the BOSS survey were utilized to measure the strength of gravitational interactions of galaxies extremely far away from each other. This is a visual representation of that measurement; the amount that the circles are distorted, or squashed from perfect concentric rings, indicates the velocity that galaxies are falling towards each other and hence the strength of the gravitational interactions.
"Gravity is the main driving force behind the growth of structure in the Universe. According to general relativity, gravity is a manifestation of the space-time curvature – massive objects curve the space-time around them, which affects the movement of other objects around them. It’s a very elegant theory that has been successful in explaining the outcomes of many experiments, however it is not the only theory of gravity," explained Samushia. "Theoretical physicists have proposed many alternative theories and modifications of general relativity and the challenge for observational physicists is to test the alternative theories with ever increasing precision." More than 600 000 galaxies from the BOSS survey were utilized to measure the strength of gravitational interactions of galaxies extremely far away from each other. This is a visual representation of that measurement; the amount that the circles are distorted, or squashed from perfect concentric rings, indicates the velocity that galaxies are falling towards each other and hence the strength of the gravitational interactions.
In January 2010, Erik Verlinde, professor ofTheoretical Physics and world-renowned string theorist, caused a worldwide stir with the publication of On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton, in which he challenged commonly held perceptions on gravity, going so far as to state ‘for me gravity doesn’t exist’. If he is proved correct, the consequences for our understanding of the universe and its origins in a Big Bang will be far-reaching.
"Everyone who is working on theoretical physics is trying to improve on Einstein," says Robbert Dijkgraaf, UvA University Professor and current director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton (where scientists including Turing, Oppenheimer and Einstein have worked) In my opinion, Erik Verlinde has found an important key for the next step forward."
Verlinde, who received the Spinoza prize (the Dutch Nobel Prize) from the Netherlands Organisation for Science, is famous for developing this new theory, or idea, on gravity in which he says that gravity is an illusion. "Gravity is not an illusion in the sense that we know that things fall," says Verline." Most people, certainly in physics, think we can describe gravity perfectly adequately using Einstein’s General Relativity. But it now seems that we can also start from a microscopic formulation where there is no gravity to begin with, but you can derive it. This is called ‘emergence’."
"We have other phenomena in Physics like this," Verlinde continued. "Take a concept like ‘temperature’, for instance. We experience it every day. We can feel temperature. But, if you really think about the microscopic molecules, there’s no notion of temperature there. It’s something that has to do with the property of all molecules together; it’s like the average energy per molecule."
To Verlinde, gravity is similar. It’s something that only appears when you put many things together at a microscopic scale and then you suddenly see that certain equations arise. "As scientists," he observes, "we first want to understand nature and our universe. In doing so, we have observed things that are deeply puzzling, such as phenomena related to dark matter. We see things happening that we don’t understand. There must be more matter out there that we don’t see. There’s also something called ‘dark energy’. And then there’s the whole puzzle of the beginning of the universe. We now have what is called the ‘Big Bang’ theory.
Verline belives his ideas will shed new light on the concept of ‘dark matter’ and ‘dark energy’ and why they’re important in relation to gravity.
"We think we understand gravity in most situations," he says "but when we look at galaxies and, on much larger scales, at galaxy clusters, we see things happening that we don’t understand using our familiar equations, like Newton’s equation of gravity or even Einstein’s gravity. So we have to assume there’s this mysterious form of matter, which we call dark matter, which we cannot see. Now dark energy is even weirder, in the sense that we don’t even know what it consists of. It’s something we can put in our equations to make things work, but there’s really a big puzzle to be solved in terms of why it’s there and what it’s made of. At present, we have not really found the right equations to describe it. There’s clearly progress to be made in terms of finding a bettertheory of gravity, and understanding what’s happening in our universe."
For example, the Big Bang theory is the idea that at a particular moment things suddenly started exploding and growing, and that our universe got bigger, which Verlinde finds illogical to think it came from this one moment.
"It’s illogical to think there was nothing and then it exploded. We use concepts like time and space," he adds, "but we don’t really understand what this means microscopically. That might change. The Big Bang has to do with our understanding of what time should be, and I think we will have a much better understanding of this in the future. I think we will figure out that what we thought was the Big Bang was actually a different kind of event. Or maybe that we should not think that the universe really began at a particular moment and that there’s another way to describe that."
Verlinde believes that the information we have today and the equations we now use only describe a very small part of what is actually going on. "If you think that something grows, like our universe, than something else must become smaller," he observes."I think there’s something we haven’t found yet and this will help us discover the origins of our universe. In short, the universe originated from something, not from nothing. There was something there and we have to find the equations. It has something to do with dark energy and how that is related to dark matter. If we understand the equations for those components of our universe, I think we’ll also have a better understanding of how the universe began. I think it’s all about the interplay between these different forms of energy and matter.
The Big Bang theory works well in the sense that it gives us some understanding of how particular elements in our universe came about and there are other things that we can observe, like the radiation that came from the Big Bang. But the whole idea of an expanding universe that started with a big explosion will change. "You need to think about the equations in a bigger setting," Verlinde observes. "You need to describe more than just the matter particles. You need to know more about what space/time is. All these things have to come together in order to be able to explain the Big Bang."
Quantum mechanics took approximately 26 years to develop, Verlinde concludes. "We’ve had string theory for 40 years and nothing yet has come out of that which can be directly tested with observations or experiments. I think my idea has a greater chance of being tested with observations, which is an exciting thing. I think it will take no more than 10 or 15 years."
The end result be belives will lead to a paradigm shift in how people think that the universe was created.

  <p>Pointing telescopes into the heavens is not merely an arbitrary practice used to study our surroundings. It is much more than that. Not only does it give us the ability to study the very laws of physics that keep the Earth in rotation around the Sun, ultimately giving way to the development of multicellular life-forms, but it also serves as some sort of a time machine, allowing us to look back at  some of the very first celestial objects created after the dawn of time.
In addition to that, we are able to determine the rate at which the universe is expanding, see stars be born and die in equal proportions, detect changes in the atmosphere of distant exoplanets and so much more, making it somewhat difficult to determine which portions are the most important. ‘ However, it has been said that due to the accelerating  expansion of the universe, the very sky we’re observing today will look radically different from the one that’ll exist in a few billions or trillions of year from now.
Assuming the universe exists in a state similar to how it is now, without the big rip, big freeze, big bounce, big slurp or any other proposed scenarios taking place,   what will our descendants see when observing distant sources of light?

<p>1,000,000 YEARS – The Sun’s New Rival:</p>

<p>Betelgeuse, which is located approximately 640 light-years from Earth in the constellation Orion — is one of the biggest and brightest stars in our galactic neighborhood. It could swallow our Sun 20 times over, whilst emitting more than 100,000 times more light. If that doesn’t convey its sheer size, let me put it this way: If you were to replaced Betelgeuse with our Sun, Betelgeuse itself would extend all the way to Jupiter, engulfing Earth and all of the planets in the inner solar system!
Despite this, the star is nearing the end of its life-span. It’s estimated that Betelgeuse could go supernova anytime in the next million years. Don’t expect the explosion to be noticeable immediately though. It would take 640 years or traveling through the interstellar medium before the light made its way all the way to Earth. What that does mean? Betelgeuse (also known as Alpha Orionis) could have already exploded hundreds of years ago, and we would have no way of knowing.
When that light does arrive, the intensity of the supernova as seen here on Earth is the subject of debate, but some think that it will be capable of being seen during the daytime and outshining the moon at night .

<p>1.4 MILLION YEARS – TURBULENT TIMES:</p>

<p>Models uncovered in 2010 say the rogue star could seriously upset the icy comets in the Oort cloud, a theoretical region located on the fringe of our solar system. The star, tentatively known as Gliese 710, is an orange dwarf star currently located some 63.8 light-years from Earth in Serpens constellation. The star is relatively unremarkable, coming in with only 60% of the total mass of the Sun’s (or it has about 67% of the Sun’s radius), but newish simulations, undertaken by Vadim Bobylev (from the Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in St Petersburg) believe it could have a remarkable impact on us.  Whilst working on the Hipparcos Catalog (it aims to collect a myriad of data centering on an object’s speed, velocity and trajectory) they located over 100,000 stars, a whopping 156 of them need to be monitored very closely, as they might someday pose an imminent threat to mankind. It isn’t uncommon for stars to make an appearance on the outer end of a planetary system. It’s just in this case, we find that the solar system in question is ours. In fact, it’s estimated that once every 2 million years, a rogue star arrives in our galactic neighborhood (defined by an area extending about 1 parsec [31 trillion kilometers/19 trillion miles] or 3.26 light-years of the Sun). The last of which, Gliese 208, passed within four light years of us about half a million years ago. Skip to 1.4 million years in the future, there is an 86% chance that Gliese 710 will come within half a parsec of the sun, where millions of comets roam. If the dinosaurs were still around, I’m sure they wouldn’t approve.

<p>8 MILLION YEARS – MARS GETS RINGS:</p>

<p>How Mars might look with rings (Credit; Darkness84 on deviantART)</p>

<p>Located approximately 5,800 miles (9,400 km) from the center of Mars, or about 3,700 miles (6,000 km) above the Martian surface, Phobos -  one of the two the natural satellites of Mars – orbits its parent planet from a distance shorter of that of any other known moon in our solar system. 
Because of this short distance from Mars, Phobos completes one full orbit around Mars before it can make one full rotation around its axis. If one could stand on the surface of the Red Planet and look up into the night sky, Phobos would zoom across the sky in just under 4 hours and 15 minutes.
The rather short orbital period of the small moon, paired with its close proximity from the planet, tidal interactions between Phobos and Mars has caused its orbital radius to decrease even further, which will eventually give way to one of two things.
Either Phobos will break apart and form an intricate set of rings that could rival the ones that famously belong to Saturn, or Phobos will reach Mars’Roche Limit: a region estimated to lie around 4350 miles (7,000 km) above the center of Mars (or 3,853 miles/6,200 km above the Martian surface) and it will crash into the surface of Mars, acting as a giant nuclear-bomb.

<p>4 BILLION YEARS – OUR SOLAR SYSTEM DIES:</p>

<p>The Sun as a Red-giant</p>

<p>You know the saying, right? “Everything that lives must die.” One day, everyone you know will be gone, then everyone they know will die too. Our solar system and the universe itself aren’t immune to such things, though they meet their destruction on a much longer time-scale. Thankfully, before  the Sun dies, the Earth will be gone —possibly swallowed up by the Sun as it transitions from a main-sequence star to a red-giant. Regardless of whether or not Earth survives the sun’s initial expansion, it will certainly be a fried hunk of rock that isn’t fit for human (or anything remotely similar) consumption. Long before those events occur, all of the water on the planet will evaporate, the rolling hills of green will wither away, the atmosphere will be lost permanently to space, taking away life, and with it, any remaining semblance of the features that make our planet what it is: home. If the surviving outer planets aren’t forced into wider orbits around the dying sun, they might be flung from our solar system entirely. After which, some of the icy moons might see a glimmer of spring for the first time, allowing a small window of time to pass when they thaw out and potentially become habitable.</p>

<p>5 BILLION YEARS – MILKDROMEDA IS BORN:</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, the Andromeda galaxy will collide with our Milky Way, forming a large elliptical galaxy. Some have suggested we name it Milkdromeda. (We really need to start working on a better name — time is running out after all!) Our solar system — now much smaller and far more obscure since the Sun is now a stellar core approximately the size of Earth — will likely be pushed out of its current orbit around the Milky Way’s center, into a much wider orbit. It can currently be found in the Orion spur of one of our galaxy’s spiral arms, situated some 25,000 light-years back from the central core. After the merger, it is expected to be pushed back  to about 100,000 light-years from the center of the galaxy. Speaking of the central region of the newly-formed Milkdromeda, it is going through a drastic phase  change of its own. The merger will inevitably result in the supermassive black holes from both galaxies combining as well, forming an ultra-massive black hole with the combined mass of billions of Suns.</p>

<p>How the collision will play out (Image Source)</p>

<p>Throughout the gradual process of this merger, which will take place over the course of hundreds of millions of years, it’s unlikely that any two stars or planets will collide. Yes, that seems strange, but remember that space is called space for a reason. The distance separating each individual star is incomprehensibly vast; even the regions that are densely packed —  like globular clusters and nebular clouds —  are very spacious. However , new life is imminent. Along with absorbing all of the stars, planets and black holes of Andromeda, the cache of the raw materials for star formation will combine, triggering the birth of hundreds of millions of new stars.  Of all of our uncertainty about the event itself (and how much it will impact both galaxies as a whole) is confounded by one thing — the utter beauty our night sky will hold. To paraphrase Carl Sagan; “We on earth marvel, and rightfully so, at the daily return of our single sun. But from a planet orbiting a star in a distant globular cluster, a still more glorious dawn awaits. Not a sunrise, but a galaxy rise. A morning filled with 400 billion suns, the rising of the Milky Way.”  </p>

<p>TEN BILLION YEARS — THE DUST SETTLES</p>

<p>This is definitely a bit dramatized for effect, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>After the merger comes to a completion, the dust will finish settling, leaving behind scant evidence to suggest an epic merger took place at all, but by observing white-dwarfs and calculating their age (and their concentration of heavy metals), astronomers may be able to deduce the existence of an event that triggered furious star formation within the galaxy. Such an event could only be one thing; a galaxy merger. After an uncertain amount of years, new star formation will halt altogether in the newly-formed elliptical galaxy. Then, after the last remaining bits of material for star formation are gone, they will leave behind a galaxy devoid of gas and dust almost entirely. Some of the material will be recycled when the first generation of stars produced in Milkdromeda explode as brilliant supernovae blasts, but at this point, our galaxy’s best days are well and truly over. Moreover, some of the most famous far-off nebulae will be gone. Imagine a galaxy with no Orion nebula; no VY Canis Majoris.. and no Pillars of Creation (granted, the Pillars might already be gone). Yes, very sad times, but perhaps the galaxy will construct even more elaborate nebulae in the wake of all we’ve already lost to time.</p>

<p>100 BILLION YEARS: THE LIGHTS START TO DIM</p>

<p>Click the image to see a larger version</p>

<p>100 billion years from now, the ever accelerating expansion of the universe — most commonly called dark energy — will cause all but 1,000 members of the Virgo Supercluster — where our galaxy, along with other members of our local group, reside— to red-shift into oblivion, never to be seen again by astronomers in our galaxy or any near-by. The visibility of galaxies located on the horizon of the observable universe at this point can be likened to light that’s captured by the event horizon of a black hole. As an object approaches the “point of no return,” its image appears to freeze and fade away because you can’t see any of the light it emits from that point forward. It is much too far away and is travelling way too fast to ever arrive to our corner of the universe, no matter how much time will pass for the light to traverse spacetime. In a similar frame of mind, this period signals the regression of the universe.  Instead of being diverse, colorful and bright, as it is now, it devolves into the universe it once was long before Earth was even around; the cosmic dark ages.</p>

<p>1 TRILLION YEARS – GOODBYE FOREVER, CMBR:</p>

<p>In a trillion years – evidence of the big bang in the form of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which was created a mere 379,000 years prior to the birth of the universe, will grow dim to the point of invisibility. From there, it will then be lost to astronomers forever, perhaps leading future generations of astronomers to believe the universe is static and unchanging. However,  future generations may eventually discover the process of nucleosynthesis (the fusion of heavy elements from lighter ones) in the core of red-dwarf stars, which are smaller, dimmer, cooler and much more common than stars like our Sun. They employ an internal process that allows them to burn for trillions of years. Due to a number of obstacles, one of which, is the dwindling supply of star formation materials, the production of stars will ultimately halt, leaving behind nothing but red-dwarf stars. There will be no more supernova blasts to use as standard candles, no more food to quench the insatiable appetite of black holes, no new planets and no more cosmic nebulae. The last is important because such nebular clouds are key to kick-starting the star formation process. (On this note, one paper has suggested that this process has begun already and more than 95% of the stars that will ever live have already been born.) Another contributing factor to this, is the perplexing existence of a little thing that is driving the universe apart, something we like to call “dark energy.” With all of the distant galaxies red-shifted out of view, how would the existence of this elusive force be known? This begs the question;
How will scientists know anything?
According to Avi Loeb (from the Harvard-Smithsoniana Center for Astrophysics), hypervelocity stars —or “true” shooting stars that only occur about once every 100,000 years —that are flung our of our galaxy at incredible speeds may be the answer to this particular cosmic quandary. These stars are usually the lone survivors of a binary or multiple star system that went awry. One of these stars can be ejected from its typical orbit after its partner is devoured by a black hole that has wandered too close to a galaxy’s center.</p>

<p>How Hypervelocity Stars Are Born (Credit: NASA, ESA, and A. Feild {STScI])</p>

<p>When this occurs, the momentum of the dead star is then transferred to the partner, allowing it to break free of the black hole’s gravitational hold, causing it to speed off on a trajectory that takes it outside of the galaxy all together — sometimes traveling at over one million miles per hour (or about 10 times faster than ordinary star movement). After the star escapes from our galaxy’s confines (some 1 trillion years in the future), it would continue to travel away from our galaxy into interstellar space, effectively becoming the most distant source of light from beyond  our galaxy’s borders. Any observer would be surprised to see the star accelerating more and more quickly as it makes its way into oblivion, until they witness it disappear over an “event horizon” where any information  can no longer be received because of the rapid expansion of space — a product of dark energy. Yes, it would take an extremely long amount of time to see this play out, but it’s not like the universe will be teeming with things that warrant close investigation. Besides hypervelocity stars, other sources of information may exist in the future, clues that can help unlock important information about the standard model of cosmology, and essentially, the creation of the universe itself.</p>

<p>100 TRILLION YEARS – THE UNIVERSE DIES:
 There are a number of hypotheses that predict how the universe will end, but the most promising one is called’the big chill.’ Under this scenario, dark energy continues driving the expansion of the universe, resulting in the temperatures dropping throughout the universe until it reaches absolute zero (or a point at which the universe can no longer be exploited to perform work). Similarly, if the expansion of the universe continues, planets, stars and galaxies are pulled so far apart that the stars would eventually lose access to raw material needed for star formation, thus the lights inevitably go out for good.
This is the point at which the universe would reach a maximum state of entropy.  Any stars that remain will continue to slowly burn away, until the last star is extinguished. Instead of fiery cradles, galaxies will become coffins filled with remnants of dead stars. It has been said in the very distant future, that intelligent civilizations will someday truly into the sky and think they are well and truly alone.  At that point, they probably are.                                                                                                [See the full article here]

<p>Regardless of how the universe is shaped over the course of the next hundred billion years and beyond — hopefully creatures on a distant planet in the Milkdromeda galaxy will have knowledge about a little blue planet named Earth in the future equivalent of text books.It’s too bad you and I won’t be here to see it, but we each play a role in the story of Earth and a little species known as homosapiens.

<p>The Hubble Ultra Deep Field is one of, if not the most, famous picture the Hubble Space Telescope has taken. Objects in this image are up to 13-bililon light-years from Earth and it reveals a comprehensive timeline for the universe. Between September 2003 and January 2004, Hubble looked at a seemingly empty patch of sky, inside the constellation Fornax, only a tenth of the size of the full moon. It came back with a stunning picture containing over 10,000 objects, pretty much all of them are galaxies containing thousands, millions, or billions of stars. Some of the galaxies are close and mature while others are brand-new – being only 600 million or so years old.
Frequently, this image is posted and will have the caption “Every spec of light in this picture is a whole galaxy. There are lots of galaxies here. That’s cool” – but with more caps-lock. What are you really looking at? The first step to understanding the sheer magnitude of how awesome this image is to, well, understand what you can actually see.
Firstly, in the foreground of the image you’ll see some large bright balls of light with a cross-like appearance. These are stars within the Milky Way. The cross is caused by the reflection of light off struts within Hubble.
As far as galaxies go, if you look around the image you’ll see some larger, well defined galaxies – or ‘modern’ galaxies. These are less than 5-billion light-years from Earth. One such galaxy is located near the bottom left corner of the image and appears yellowish.
Further away, we have galaxies between 5 and 10 billion light-years away. They have a galaxy look to them, but they aren’t as defined as the older, more modern galaxies. One such example is a collection of galaxies located above the right center edge and over about a sixth. Since the early universe was a turbulent time, it isn’t uncommon to see galaxies merging, an example is a trio of interacting galaxies in the same area I just described to you (appearing purpleish, and red-orangeish depending on the galaxy).
Finally, at the edge of this image, you’ll see tiny red blobs of the universes youngest galaxies. They are peppered throughout the image. A good example of one is a oblong galaxy – if you found the pair of interacting galaxies from the above paragraph, travel in a straight line down from them, just past the center line of the image you’ll hit the a little red line. That is one of the first galaxies that formed in the universe and will later serve as a core for a more mature galaxy similar to the ones we see today.
So, look around the image (especially if you can find a nice big high resolution one you can zoom around with). This image shows a timeline of the formation of galaxies from some of their earliest moments to the modern monsters we have today. This image also helps us to see and understand the incredible vastness of our universe.
It is a rather stunning picture.</p>

<p>Throughout the universe, there are several underlying principles that we consider to be constants; for example, the speed of light in a vacuum. So many different aspects of our understanding of the universe comes from this one constant. If the speed of light wasn’t constant, GPS systems wouldn’t work, and we wouldn’t be able to determine the age of distant galaxies in the universe. Most of Einstein’s equations would fall apart without a constant speed of light; time dilation and , the mass-energy relationship would fluctuate and quantum fluctuations on the Plank scale could potentially have large scale effects.
The speed of light in a vacuum is considered to be constant, never changing over the last 13 billion years. However, there are a number of other constants, and the one we’re going to be discussing here is the gravitational constant.
The Gravitational Constant:
The Gravitational Constant has a value of 6.67384×10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2. Now, this possibly looks a bit messy but it basically means that gravity has a set strength. A strength that works in 3-dimensional space, is an accelerating force and is determined by mass. It is because of the set value of the gravitational constant that we’re able to accurate determine the mass of two orbiting objects. We can calculate the amount of force imparted on us by the Earth to keep us on the Earth – 9.81 m/s^2.</p>

<p>A hand drawing of the device that Henry Cavendish used to measure the Gravitational Constant.Image: Henry Cavendish</p>

<p>So far as we can tell, the gravitational constant has remained constant throughout the entire history of the universe. This has, however, been VERY difficult to prove! Measurements of the gravitational constant over the past 200 years have been erratic. Even as the techniques that we use now are far more advanced and sensitive than were used two centuries ago, the true value of the gravitational constant remains elusive.
In 2013, a group of researchers working out of France took the measurement of the gravitational constant, using the same machine that they’d used some 2 years earlier. Improvements were made on the machine to improve the sensitivity and give a more accurate result. The machine, which uses two independent methods to calculate the constant, averages the results of the two. This, in theory, should help reduce systematic errors. What did they find? A different result!
Why is the Gravitational Constant so hard to pinpoint?
At first it may seem strange that the gravitational constant is so hard to determine. There are four fundamental forces in the universe:
• Strong Force
• Weak Force
• Electromagnetism
• Gravity
Gravity is by far the weakest of the four forces, which, may also sound a little strange considering what we see in the universe. When looking out into the cosmos, gravity appears to be the reigning king of all. Gravity is so strong that it causes stars to fuse hydrogen into helium, collapses stellar cores into neutron stars and black holes, creates quasars and dictates the flow of matter within the entire universe.</p>

<p>On a large scale, gravity wins. But, as was previously mentioned, gravity is the weakest of the four forces. The reason for this discrepancy is, as a force, gravity travels further and has a slower fall off. The strongest of the four forces, the Strong Force, becomes almost non-existent at distances outside of a nucleus. What makes gravity stronger in macro circumstances is that it is accumulative. The more matter there is, the more gravity.
But still, gravity is weaker. Therefore, when trying to measure it, the other forces can cause systematic errors. It is akin to trying to measure the weight of a feather, outdoors, in a slight breeze, with an old pair of scales. The first thought would be to try to remove the other sources of error. We do this by doing several different experiments and then averaging the results. We are not yet aware of a single perfect test to measure the gravitational constant.
Over the last century, nearly every time the gravitational constant has been measured, we’ve observed a different value. At first glance, you may think that means we’re getting closer to its true value; however, it is hard to tell. It is currently uncertain as to whether the constant has actually been changing marginally over time or just compounding systematic errors. Another theory is that there many be a correlation between dark energy and gravity. Yet another theory states that the constant is always fluctuating around an average value and that if we keep testing it over an even longer period of time, we will find the true average value.
It is nice to still have mysteries in the universe, things that we done quite understand. Incredibly small changes in the gravitational constant can affect the rate at which stars form, their size and how long they remain on their main sequence. Maybe we will never know for sure, remaining one of the universes true mysteries.</p>

If you want to confirm the existence of gravitational waves, space-time ripples predicted by Albert Einstein in his theory of general relativity, or want to determine to what extent the law of gravity on the macroscopic scale, as described by Sir Isaac Newton, continues to apply at the microscopic scale, you need to detect and measure forces and motions that are almost incomprehensively tiny. For example, at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), scientists are attempting to record motions as small as one thousandth the diameter of a proton.
This week, what is believed to be the smallest force ever measured has been detected by researchers with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and the University of California (UC) Berkeley. Using a combination of lasers and a unique optical trapping system that provides a cloud of ultracold atoms, the researchers measured a force of approximately 42 yoctonewtons. A yoctonewton is one septillionth of a newton and there are approximately 3 x 1023 yoctonewtons in one ounce of force.
“We applied an external force to the center-of-mass motion of an ultracold atom cloud in a high-finesse optical cavity and measured the resulting motion optically,” says Dan Stamper-Kurn, a physicist who holds joint appointments with Berkeley Lab’s Materials Sciences Division and the UC Berkeley Physics Department. “When the driving force was resonant with the cloud’s oscillation frequency, we achieved a sensitivity that is consistent with theoretical predictions and only a factor of four above the Standard Quantum Limit, the most sensitive measurement that can be made.”
Mechanical oscillators translate an applied force into measureable mechanical motion illustrated in the image below. The Standard Quantum Limit is imposed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, in which the measurement itself perturbs the motion of the oscillator, a phenomenon known as “quantum back-action.”
                   
 
Stamper-Kurn is the corresponding author of a paper in Science that describes these results. The paper is titled “Optically measuring force near the standard quantum limit.” Co-authors are Sydney Schreppler, Nicolas Spethmann, Nathan Brahms, Thierry Botter and Maryrose Barrios.
At the heart of all ultrasensitive detectors of force are mechanical oscillators, systems for translating an applied force into measureable mechanical motion. As measurements of force and motion reach quantum levels in sensitivity, however, they bump up against a barrier imposed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, in which the measurement itself perturbs the motion of the oscillator, a phenomenon known as “quantum back-action.” This barrier is called the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). Over the past couple of decades, a wide array of strategies have been deployed to minimize quantum back-action and get ever closer to the SQL, but the best of these techniques fell short by six to eight orders of magnitude.
“We measured force with a sensitivity that is the closest ever to the SQL,” says Sydney Schreppler, a member of the Stamper-Kurn research group and lead author of the Science paper. “We were able to achieve this sensitivity because our mechanical oscillator is composed of only 1,200 atoms.”
In the experimental set-up used by Schreppler, Stamper-Kurn and their colleagues, the mechanical oscillator element is a gas of rubidium atoms optically trapped and chilled to nearly absolute zero. The optical trap consists of two standing-wave light fields with wavelengths of 860 and 840 nanometers that produce equal and opposite axial forces on the atoms. Center-of-mass motion is induced in the gas by modulating the amplitude of the 840 nanometer light field. The response is measured using a probe beam with a wavelength of 780 nanometers.
“When we apply an external force to our oscillator it is like hitting a pendulum with a bat then measuring the reaction,” says Schreppler. “A key to our sensitivity and approaching the SQL is our ability to decouple the rubidium atoms from their environment and maintain their cold temperature. The laser light we use to trap our atoms isolates them from external environmental noise but does not heat them, so they can remain cold and still enough to allow us to approach the limits of sensitivity when we apply a force.”
Schreppler says it should be possible to get even closer to the SQL for force sensitivity through a combination of colder atoms and improved optical detection efficiency. She also says there are back-action evading techniques that can be taken by performing non-standard measurements. For now, the experimental approach demonstrated in this study provides a means by which scientists trying to detect gravitational waves can compare the limits of their detection abilities to the predicted amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves. For those seeking to determine whether Newtonian gravity applies to the quantum world, they now have a way to test their theories. The enhanced force-sensitivity in this experiment could also point the way to improved atomic force microscopy.
“A scientific paper in 1980 predicted that the SQL might be reached within five years,” Schreppler says. “It took about 30 years longer than predicted, but we now have an experimental set-up capable both of reaching very close to the SQL and of showing the onset of different kinds of obscuring noise away from that SQL.”
