  <p>NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft has returned high-resolution, richly detailed images of Pluto and its moon Charon, revealing surfaces that are confounding in their complexity.
New Horizons is equipped with seven instruments for studying all aspects of the Pluto system. Click on the image to see brief descriptions of each instrument. NASA / JHU-APL / SWRI 
It’s been two months since the New Horizons spacecraft zipped by Pluto and its family of moons. Because of the spacecraft’s rather small radio antenna, only a handful of images and other data could be returned to Earth during and just after the historic encounter. Then the spacecraft stopped returning images for several weeks while it gathered critical measurements of the solar wind’s charged particles and electromagnetic fields.
But the picture pipeline reopened beginning on September 5th, and the project team has released several new images that show even more detail on the surfaces of Pluto and its largest moon, Charon. Some resolve images as small as 400 meters (¼ mile) across. While few researchers expected these dwarf worlds to appear drab, ho-hum spheres randomly pocked with impact craters, planetary scientists have been gobsmacked by the geologic breadth and complexity that each displays.
So feast your eyes on New Horizons’ just-released images. Many more like these, along with detailed spectra and other observations, await transmission to Earth. (I can’t wait to learn whether the spacecraft succeeded in recording the night side of Pluto illuminated only by feeble light reflected off Charon.) In fact, mission scientists have started making weekly postings of raw, unprocessed views from the spacecraft’s Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI). This week’s additions include images of Charon, Nix, and Hydra.</p>

This computer-generated perspective of Pluto utilizes high-resolution images taken by NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft on July 14, 2015. It shows what you’d see from a vantage point roughly 1,800 km (1,100 miles) above Pluto’s equatorial area. The view looks northeast over the dark, cratered terrain (informally named Cthulhu Regio) and toward a bright, smooth, expanse of icy plains (Sputnik Planum). The area shown is 1,800 km (1,100 miles) across.NASA / JHU-APL / SWRI
The informally named Sputnik Planum dominates this mosaic of high-resolution images of Pluto. Note the smooth, bright region across the center. This image also features a tremendous variety of other landscapes over an area roughly 1,600 km (1,000 miles) wide. New Horizons recorded these views from a distance of 80,000 km (50,000 miles) on July 14, 2015.NASA / JHU-APL / SWRI
In the center of this 470-km-wide (300-mile) portion of Pluto is a large region of jumbled, broken terrain that planetary geologists term “chaotic.” It’s located on the northwestern edge of the vast, icy plain informally called Sputnik Planum (to the right). The smallest visible features are 0.8 km (0.5 mile) across. New Horizons took this image on July 14, 2015, from a distance of 80,000 km (50,000 miles).  NASA / JHU-APL / SWRI
Pluto displays incredibly diverse surface reflectivities and geological landforms. The image includes dark, ancient heavily cratered terrain; bright, smooth geologically young terrain; assembled masses of mountains; and an enigmatic field of dark, aligned ridges that resemble dunes whose origin is under debate. The view is 350 km (220 miles) wide, and the smallest visible features are 0.8 km (0.5 mile) across.NASA / JHU-APL / SWRI
A New Horizons image, processed two different ways, shows how Pluto’s bright, high-altitude atmospheric haze produces a twilight that softly illuminates the surface before sunrise and after sunset, allowing the spacecraft’s sensitive cameras to see details in nighttime regions that would otherwise be invisible. The righthand version of the image has been greatly enhanced to bring out faint details of rugged haze-lit topography beyond Pluto’s day-night terminator.NASA / JHU-APL / SWRI
Two different versions of an image of Pluto’s haze layers, taken by New Horizons as it looked back at Pluto’s dark side nearly 16 hours after close approach, from a distance of 770,000 km (480,000 miles) and a Sun-Pluto-spacecraft phase angle of 166°. (The Sun illuminates Pluto from the upper right.) These images, much higher quality than the digitally compressed versions sent to Earth shortly after the July 14th encounter, allow many new details to be seen. In the left version, faint surface details can be seen through the haze on the narrow sunlit crescent at upper right. Subtle parallel streaks in the haze might be crepuscular rays — shadows cast on the haze by topography such as mountains, similar to the rays sometimes seen in the sky after the Sun sets behind mountains on Earth. The righthand version has been specially processed to reveal a large number of discrete haze layers in the atmosphere.NASA / JHU-APL / SWRI
New Horizons captured this view of Charon from a distance of 470,000 km (290,000 miles) and about 10 hours before coming its closest to Pluto on July 14, 2015. About 1,200 km (750 miles) in diameter, Charon displays a surprisingly complex geological history, including tectonic fracturing, relatively smooth, fractured plains (seen at lower right), several enigmatic mountains surrounded by sunken terrain features (right side), and heavily cratered regions (center of disk and at upper left). The surface also displays complex reflectivity patterns, including bright and dark crater rays and the conspicuous dark region at the north pole. The smallest visible features are 4.6 km (2.9 miles) across. NASA / JHU-APL / SWRI

<p> 
Working in a cave complex deep beneath South Africa’s Malmani dolomites, an international team of scientists has brought to light an unprecedented trove of hominin fossils – more than 1,500 well-preserved bones and teeth – representing the largest, most complete set of such remains found to date in Africa. The discovery, cached in a barely accessible chamber in a subterranean labyrinth not far from Johannesburg, adds a new branch to the human family tree, a creature dubbed Homo naledi.
The remains, scientists believe, could only have been deliberately placed in the cave.
Skeletal fossils of Homo naledi are pictured above in the Wits bone vault at the Evolutionary Studies Institute at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa, on Sept. 13, 2014. The fossils are among nearly 1,700 bones and teeth retrieved from a nearly inaccessible cave near Johannesburg. The fossil trove was created, scientists believe, by Homo naledi repeatedly secreting the bodies of their dead companions in the cave. Analysis of the fossils – part of a project known as the Rising Star Expedition – was led in part by paleoanthropologist John Hawks, professor of anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
So far, parts of at least 15 skeletons representing individuals of all ages have been found and the researchers believe many more fossils remain in the chamber. It is part of a complex of limestone caves near what is called “The Cradle of Humankind,” a World Heritage Site in Gauteng province well known for critical paleoanthropological discoveries of early humans, including the 1947 discovery of 2.3 million-year-old Australopithecus africanus.
 </p>

<p> 
“We have a new species of Homo, with all of its interesting characteristics,” says Hawks, one of the leaders of a team that painstakingly retrieved the fossils under excruciatingly cramped and difficult conditions. “We now have the biggest discovery in Africa for hominins.”
The find was reported today (Sept. 10, 2015) with the publication of two papers in the open access journal eLife by a group led by paleoanthropologist Lee R. Berger of the University of Witwatersrand. The expedition to retrieve the fossils and their subsequent analysis was supported by the National Geographic Society.
With a small head and brain, hunched shoulders, powerful hands and thin limbs, Homo naledi was built for long-distance walking, says Hawks, an expert on early humans. Fully grown, it stood about five feet tall, was broad chested, walked upright and had a face, including a smile that was probably more human than apelike. Powerful hands imply it was also a climber.
The fossils have yet to be dated. The unmineralized condition of the bones and the geology of the cave have prevented an accurate dating, says Hawks. “They could have been there 2 million years ago or 100,000 years ago, possibly coexisting with modern humans. We don’t yet have a date, but we’re attempting it in every way we can.”
So far, the remains of newborns to the aged have been retrieved from the cave and the researchers expect that many more bones remain in the chamber, which is nearly 100 feet underground and accessible only after squeezing, clambering and crawling 600 feet to a large chamber where the brittle fossils cover the floor.
“We know about every part of the anatomy, and they are not at all like humans,” notes Hawks, who co-directed the analysis of the fossils. “We couldn’t match them to anything that exists. It is clearly a new species.”
The astonishing find was made initially by amateur cavers and thought at the time to be a single hominin skeleton. The fossils were retrieved by a band of diminutive paleoanthropologists, all women, recruited for their size.
“Naledi” means star in the Sesotho language and is a reference to the Rising Star cave system that includes the chamber, known as the Dinaledi Chamber, where the fossils were found. The circuitous and difficult passage to the chamber narrows at one point to a bare seven inches.
In addition to identifying an entirely new species in the genus Homo, the collections of fossils, which bear no marks from predators or scavengers, are strong evidence that Homo naledi was deliberately depositing its dead in the cave, according to Hawks, a UW-Madison professor of anthropology.
“We think it is the first instance of deliberate and ritualized secreting of the dead,” says Hawks. “The only plausible scenario is they deliberately put bodies in this place.”
The cave, according to Hawks, was likely more accessible to Homo naledi than it is today for modern humans. Geochemical tests, however, show that the cave was never open to the surface, raising intriguing questions about the behavior and technologies available to the creatures.
“We know it was not a death trap,” says Hawks, referring to natural features like hidden sinkholes that sometimes trap and doom creatures over long periods of time. “There are no bones from other animals aside from a few rodents. And there are no marks on the bones from predators or scavengers to suggest they were killed and dragged to the chamber. We can also rule out that it was a sudden mass death.”
Instead, Hawks, Berger and their colleagues believe the chamber was something like a repository. “It seems probable that a group of hominins was returning to this place over a period of time and depositing bodies,” Hawks explains, adding that the supposition is akin to discovering similar behavior in chimpanzees. “It would be that surprising.”
The way the bodies are arranged and their completeness suggests they were carried to the cave intact. “The bodies were not intentionally covered and we’re not talking about a religious ceremony, but something that was repeated and repeated in the same place. They clearly learned to do this and did it as a group over time. That’s cultural. Only humans and close relatives like Neandertals do anything like this.”
So far, no other organic materials or evidence of fire have been found in the cave complex.
Dating the fossils remains a key problem to solve, says Hawks. “We depend on the geology to help us date things, and here the geology isn’t much like other caves in South Africa. And the fossils don’t have anything within them that we can date. It’s a problem for us.”
One hope, he says, is finding the remains of an animal that may have been a contemporary of Homo naledi. The fossils are embedded in a matrix of soft sediment and there are layers that remain unexcavated.
According to Hawks, years of work remain at the site and to document and analyze all of the materials excavated from the Dinaledi Chamber. Plans, he says, include bringing many new technologies to bear on analyzing the fossils to help determine diet, rate of aging and where on the landscape the creatures may have been from.
The project to excavate the fossils and the May 2014 scientific workshop to analyze them were supported by the National Geographic Society, the South African National Research Foundation, the Gauteng Provincial Government, and Wits University. The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation also provided support, as did the Texas A&amp;M College of Liberal Arts Seed Grant Program.
Berger led the Rising Star expedition as National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence. The expedition involved an international team of scientists, including six “underground astronauts” who descended into the Dinaledi chamber to excavate and retrieve the fossils of Homo naledi.
JOURNEY TO AMAZING HOMININ DISCOVERY STARTED ON FACEBOOK
“We need perhaps three or four individuals with excellent archaeological/paleontological excavation skills for a short term project that may kick off as early as November 1st 2013 and last the month if all logistics go as planned. The catch is this - the person must be skinny and preferably small. They must not be claustrophobic, they must be fit, they should have some caving experience, climbing experience would be a bonus. They must be willing to work in cramped quarters, have a good attitude and be a team player.”
Although University of Wisconsin-Madison anthropology graduate student Alia Gurtov didn’t quite know why she was raising her hand in response, she fit the bill. Slight in stature with a background in paleoanthropology, including work at famed Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, Gurtov took a flyer.
“I just applied,” Gurtov recalls. “In a very bizarre email, I gave my dimensions and my CV” and soon after, the Wisconsin researcher was on a flight to South Africa – where she would play a lead role in discovering and retrieving the largest, most complete store of hominin fossils on a continent famous for such discoveries.
A bantam frame was needed because Gurtov and five other small women scientists were about to enter a difficult and dangerous subterranean labyrinth. Going down into the South African earth, Gurtov and her diminutive colleagues would clamber, crawl, climb and, finally, drop into a space where they could enter a chamber last visited hundreds of thousands or perhaps millions of years ago by creatures that, scientists believe, were repeatedly secreting their dead companions, protecting them from scavengers and, at the same time, creating an astonishing paleontological record of a lost member of the tribe of humanity, a hominin species dubbed Homo naledi.
“It was very, very narrow,” recalls Gurtov. “There is a 7-inch chokepoint. The only way I could fit in is if I had my head turned to the side.”
The grueling 20- to 25-minute commute from daylight to the chamber of fossils included technical climbing, where the researchers, aided by an experienced caver, donned harnesses to mount a feature called the “Dragon’s Back.” Gurtov and her colleagues were forced to navigate several “squeezes,” including one 15-foot section called the “Superman Crawl,” where forward progress required wriggling on one’s belly with arms extended like the soaring Man of Steel. The final leg of the underground foray, “the worst chokepoint,” involved slithering down a 12-foot, crag-studded chute in the dark.
The expedition, overseen by noted paleoanthropologist Lee Berger of the University of Witwatersrand, was organized to investigate what was believed to be a single hominin skeleton, first spotted by cavers.
“You’re in this initial chamber and then you have to squeeze through a crevice that opens into the chamber where the skull was observed,” Gurtov explains.
Entering for the first time, she recalls, was a solemn moment. “It had the feeling of a tiny cathedral. It was just so still and dynamic at the same time. There was a sense of ages. It was absolutely silent. The floor was covered in skeletal material.”
“We knew there was a skull in there. We had no idea we were going to find more than that,” says the Wisconsin researcher.
Typically at the site of a hominin discovery, the first thing examined are the teeth, because they are telltale and – as the hardest materials in the body – tend to preserve well, says Gurtov, who spends much of her time at Tanzania’s Olduvai Gorge looking at the teeth of animals preyed upon by ancient hominins. “We saw pretty quick that we had more teeth than would fit in a single mouth,” Gurtov happily notes. When not in the cave, she lent her expertise on dentition to the group assembled to analyze the fossils.
Over that month in the field, Gurtov and her companions returned many times to the chamber, now known as the Dinaledi Chamber. Working 6- to 8-hour shifts below ground, the team recovered more than 1,500 pieces of bone by clearing the floor and excavating one small section of soft cave floor sediment, a puzzle box of fossils. “It was like pick-up sticks,” says Gurtov. “You couldn’t get one thing out without excavating something else. The sheer volume of material makes it unique.”
The fossils were excavated according to the forensic techniques prescribed by paleontology, often with a toothpick, from the cave’s clumpy, wet sediment. Wrapped in paper and nested in plastic containers, the bones of Homo naledi were prepped for the journey out to another kind of vault where they would be measured, documented, studied and reconstructed to reveal an entirely new species of hominin.

  <p>A major discovery out of South Africa is set to change our whole understanding of ancient human ancestors and evolution claim scientists. The bones of new species of human relative have reportedly been found in a burial chamber in South Africa. Dubbed “Homo naledi”, the hominins are believed to have buried their dead—an advanced practice thought to have been limited to modern humans.
This find is being dubbed one of the greatest fossil discoveries of the past half century, and the largest fossil hominin find in Africa announced National Geographic today.

  <p>Researchers at UC Berkeley managed to generate the map with the help of a US department of energy supercomputer, showing how the hot molten rock doesn’t rise up in a straight line.
Also, the base of the island may not be directly beneath it.
Rather, the plumes – which are 400-degrees hotter than surrounding rock, and are far wider below the surface than geophysicists had presumed – rise haphazardly and then widen as they get to the surface.
The latter aspect is what shapes volcanic islands, like Hawaii, with the lower rock often not directly connected to what we consider islands, thanks to a meandering rise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The research actually shows two huge, 5,000km-across “blobs” of hot rock, directly opposite each other under Africa and the Pacific Ocean, which have stayed in position for 250 million years.
It paints a new image of how the onion-like make up of the planet actually works.
At the Earth’s core lies solid iron, with an outer core of liquid, molten iron and nickel.
Wrapped around that is hot, solid rock almost 3,000km thick, with our oceans and continents on top of that.
The way the hot rock rises, though, means it is probably entirely different to the cooler rock it envelops.
The 1,800-mile thick mantle under the Pacific Ocean, rising erratically, via Scott French
“These columns are clearly separated in the lower mantle and they go all the way up to about 1,000 km below the surface, but then they start to thin out in the upper part of the mantle, and they meander and deflect,” said senior author Barbara Romanowicz.
“So while the tops of the plumes are associated with hotspot volcanoes, they are not always vertically under them.”
This research, published in Nature, means that those childhood schoolbooks that showed volvanoes, with a red line of lava going straight down the middle, directly into the Earth’s core, are wrong.
Most volcanic hotspots are linked to plumes of hot rock (red) rising from two spots on the boundary between the metal core and rocky mantle 1,800 miles below Earth’s surface
However, the techniques used to generate the map – studying the seismic waves from 273 earthquakes over the last 20 years – is not perfect. For example, Yellowstone’s volcano was not accurately portrayed.
The plumes that feed them may be too thin to be detected given the computational limits of the global modelling technique, said co-author Scott French.
The duo hope that a swathe of higher-resolution imagery from supercomputers can be achieved, allowing them to zoom in on particular areas.
“Tomography is the most powerful method to get this information, but in the future it will be combined with very sensitive gravity measurements from satellites and maybe electromagnetic sounding, where people do conductivity measurements of the interior,” said Romanowicz.

  <p>The open source map project published in Nature this week shows us that neutrinos and antineutrinos are everywhere around us, and don’t just come from sun rays and nuclear reactors, but can be detected within the Earth, its atmosphere and, of course, across the cosmos.
The neutrino was theorised by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930 to explain the continuous energy spectrum of nuclear beta rays. Further research by Enrico Fermi around the time of the Manhattan Project in the 1940s produced a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction caused by antineutrinos, antimatter cousins to neutrinos and the smallest particles known to science.
The scientists conclude that the level of interactions between these particles means that the Earth is pretty much a “neutrino star” in terms of the sheer amount of radiation activity.

  <p>The question of how many trees are in the world is not just an opportunity for a brain-teaser, but vital in terms of understanding the rate of deforestation globally, particularly when millions of trees are cut down daily.
But now, a team from Yale University has gone to great lengths to combine data from satellite imagery, forest inventories and supercomputer-powered calculations to estimate the amount of trees at a square-kilometre level.
Publishing its results in Nature, the three trillion trees figure that has been generated has shown that since the start of major human civilisation the planet’s tree population has plummeted by almost half (46pc).
Using the current number, this amount would equate to 422 trees to every person on Earth.
From the 400,000 plots included in the study, the world’s densest forests were found to be located in the boreal forests in the sub-arctic regions of Russia, Scandinavia, and North America.
However, in terms of what were deemed the largest forests, those located in the tropics were found to account for 43pc of the world’s total trees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Puts environment into perspective
With this new information, the 15 country-led study will be able to significantly increase the capability of major environmental models relating to climate change and the distribution of life across the planet.
Speaking of the report’s findings, lead author of the story, Thomas Crowther, said: “[Trees] store huge amounts of carbon, are essential for the cycling of nutrients, for water and air quality, and for countless human services.
“Yet you ask people to estimate, within an order of magnitude, how many trees there are and they don’t know where to begin. I don’t know what I would have guessed, but I was certainly surprised to find that we were talking about trillions.”
Adding the importance of comparing today’s number with the estimate at the dawn of human civilisation, Crowther added: “We’ve nearly halved the number of trees on the planet, and we’ve seen the impacts on climate and human health as a result. This study highlights how much more effort is needed if we are to restore healthy forests worldwide.”

  <p>A small body known as 2014 MU69, found by the Hubble Space Telescope barely a year ago, will be the next destination for NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft.
NASA’s New Horizons team members are still basking in the afterglow of July’s historic flyby of Pluto — and still awaiting most of the observations made there. But they’re already anticipating the spacecraft’s second and likely final encounter in the distant Kuiper Belt.
An artist’s conception of New Horizons reaching 2014 MU69, its designated Kuiper Belt target. Alex Parker
Last week the space agency announced the spacecraft’s target. It’s 2014 MU69, an object situated 43.3 astronomical units (6.49 billion km) from the Sun. Astronomers know little about 2014 MU69, other than it’s an incredibly dim 25.6-magnitude blip. It’s not big — assuming a surface that’s 20% reflective (just a guess), astronomers estimate its diameter to be about 45 km (30 miles) across. That’s roughly 10 times the size of a typical comet.
But New Horizons isn’t zeroing in on this object based on its size or any other physical characteristic. Instead, it’s all about location. The spacecraft should be able to reach 2014 MU69 in a reasonable amount of time and still have comfortable fuel reserves for its maneuvering engines once it gets there. Plans call for a series of four trajectory corrections in late October and early November to set course for a rendezvous on January 1, 2019.
It all seems so matter of fact. But finding a suitable post-Pluto target became an urgent problem in early 2014, after 3 years of intensive searching with ground-based telescopes failed to find one. Fortunately, last-ditch searches with the Hubble Space Telescope from July through September turned up three potential targets (PTs). Follow-up observations showed that 2014 MU69 — PT1 in Hubble’s short list — was the best all-around choice. Runner-up PT3, designated 2014 PN70, is a slightly larger body, but it would have required more fuel to reach.
Despite its small size, New Horizons scientists are excited about what 2014 MU69 might teach them about the formation and evolution of the distant Kuiper Belt in which it lies. New Frontiers in the Solar System, a “decadal” blueprint for future planetary exploration released in 2003 by the National Academy of Sciences, strongly recommended that small Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) be included in any mission to Pluto.
After a 9½-year-long trip to Pluto, New Horizons is headed for the tiny object 2014 MU69. Initially designated “PT1” when discovered in 2014, this object lies 4 billion miles from the Sun and won’t be reached until early 2019. (Yellow arc denotes New Horizons’ trajectory.)Alex Parker
This object’s orbit is nearly circular (eccentricity = 0.05) and inclined just 2½°. So it has not been strongly perturned or altered since the solar system’s formation 4½ billion years ago. “2014 MU69 is a great choice because it is just the kind of ancient KBO, formed where it orbits now, that the Decadal Survey desired us to fly by,” notes Alan Stern, the mission’s principal investigator, in a press release announcing the selection.
But just because New Horizons has a suitable target doesn’t guarantee that it will be operating once it gets there. Technically the spacecraft is in tip-top shape and fully able to accomplish another close flyby. But first the team needs to make a compelling scientific case for doing so. That proposal, due next year, will be evaluated against other missions competing for the space agency’s funds. NASA managers will then decide if it’s worth extending the mission’s funding for at least three more years.
Meanwhile, astronomers will continue studying this object to refine its orbit and perhaps to get a better handle on its diameter and shape. But don’t expect a permanent number or name for it anytime soon. According to Gareth Williams (Minor Planet Center) it will be mid-2016 at the very earliest, and more likely mid-2017, before the orbit of 2014 MU69 is known well enough to justify a better moniker.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Wormholes” are cosmic tunnels that can connect two distant regions of the universe, and have been popularized by the dissemination of theoretical physics and by works of science fiction like Stargate, Star Trek or, more recently, Interstellar. Using present-day technology it would be impossible to create a gravitational wormhole, as the field would have to be manipulated with huge amounts of gravitational energy, which no one yet knows how to generate. In electromagnetism, however, advances in metamaterials and invisibility have allowed researchers to put forward several designs to achieve this.</p>
