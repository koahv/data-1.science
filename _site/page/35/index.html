>One of the greatest challenges facing humanity in the 21st century is the destruction of the natural environment. Researchers have found that environmental change over the last 60 years is happening at a rate unseen in the past 10 000 years. Human-driven climate change, the loss of biosphere integrity, land system change, and the high amounts of biochemicals flowing into oceans due to fertilizer use are said to have reached an unsafe level. With these problems in mind, environmental conservation has become a hot topic in modern society. Nevertheless, this concept has been around for a much longer period of time, and can even be found in Sanskrit texts from ancient India.Read moreSection:&nbsp;NewsHistoryAncient Traditions...
