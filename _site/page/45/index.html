  <p>(European Association of Geochemistry) So perhaps there is some truth in the old legends of the underworld reeking of brimstone (or sulfur, as it is now called)? New research confirms that the Earth’s core does in fact contain vast amounts of sulfur, estimated to be about 10 times the amount of sulfur in the rest of the Earth, based on the most recent estimates (and for comparison, around 10 percent of the total mass of the moon).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The news came following the publication of Solar Power Europe’s (SPE) Global Market Outlook 2-15-2019 report, which highlighted Germany, Greece and Italy as Europe’s biggest proponents of the technology.
Among the findings of the report, the analysis shows that the world’s total solar energy capacity now stands at 178GW, with 40GW created in 2014, up from 37GW created in 2013.
The three European nations mentioned previously got the gold stars from SPE because their total national solar energy creation now accounts for 7pc of their entire energy output.
However, the UK were the most proactive in 2014, constructing 2.4GW-worth of solar energy, followed by Germany (1.9GW) and France (927MW).
China has maintained its position as the world’s largest creator of solar energy — producing five times as much solar energy as Germany — and installing 10.6GW in 2014, with its Asian neighbour Japan following suit with 9.7GW, and the US somewhat behind again with 6.5GW in the same time period.
Making predictions for 2020, SPE are very optimistic for the technology, predicting that by then world solar energy creation could leap to 540GW, but says that the more likely figure is a still-impressive 450GW.
Looking towards the end of this year, the report says China alone will have created 17.6GW of new solar plants, close to its original target set at the beginning of the year of 17.8GW.

<blockquote>
  <p>“Not only rational and irrational, but even inanimate creatures have a voice, and speak loudly to men, and it is our duty to learn their language, and hearken to them.”
Since the dawn of time, trees — the oldest living things in our world — have been our silent companions, which we’ve transmuted into the myths and metaphors through which we make sense of the world — from their deity-like role in ancient Indian legends to their long history as the perfect visual metaphor for visualizing human knowledge to their symbolic representation of the cycle of life. Perhaps because they are so strong and so silent, bearing steadfast witness to our earthly lives and while reaching up toward the heavens, we’ve long projected our spiritual longings onto trees and turned to them for answers to our existential questions.
Four centuries before Hermann Hesse proclaimed trees “the most penetrating of preachers,” the English author Ralph Austen, who wrote in great detail and with great beauty about various aspects of gardening, explored just that in a peculiar pamphlet titled The Spiritual Use of an Orchard or Garden of Fruit Trees (public library) — the companion to his 1653 book A Treatise on Fruit-trees, showing the manner of grafting, setting, pruning, and ordering of them in all respects. Beneath the highly religious language of the era and the highly esoteric subject of the book lie unexpectedly elegant metaphors for human concerns of eternal resonance to secular life — from the secret of lasting relationships to the true test of character.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The book was republished nearly two centuries later, with this disarming note to the reader from the editor and publisher, a T. Pettit from London’s Soho, making the modern reader — this modern reader, at least — wistfully wishful that publishers today had such courtesy and warmth for their audiences:
Come, now learn a parable of the Fig tree — and (believe it) there are but two things requisite to enable you to learn to profit or profitably:
first, a heart to receive instruction;
second, The Great Teacher for your instructor;
and then, I am sure you will get heavenly lessons by heart.
I leave the worthy Author to tell his own story, and so bid you heartily welcome to a participation of some of the Fruits to be gather’d from this Orchard.
Grace be with you, and farewell,
so says your Servant,
The Editor.
Waltham Abbey,
September 26, 1847
In the original 1653 “Preface to the Reader,” Austen vows to “endeavour to make some spiritual use, and improvement of [fruit trees]” and writes:
When we have gone through all the works and labours to be performed in the orchard, and have received thereby a rich recompense of temporal profits and pleasures in the use of the trees and fruits, we may (besides all that) make a spiritual use of them, and receive more and greater profits and pleasures thereby. Men are not wont to stint themselves at worldly profits, but why are they not willing to receive all kinds of profits, or why are they not willing to receive the greatest, and the best? … How much more foolish and unwise, is he that seeks after temporal profits, and neglects spiritual, and eternal? Therefore be careful to make a spiritual improvement of fruit trees.</p>

<p>But while Austen’s text bears the deep religiosity of his era, at its heart is a deeper, timeless wisdom that speaks to those of us who are nonreligious but invested in attaining a sense of secular spirituality — for who can deny that trees teach us to belong to our own lives? Trees, he assures us, contain great gospels of truth:
The world is a great library, and fruit trees are some of the books wherein we may read and see plainly the attributes of God, his power, wisdom, goodness &#038;c. … for as trees (in a metaphorical sense)* are books, so like-wise in the same sense they have a voice, and speak plainly to us, and teach us many good lessons.
[…]
Fruit trees, though they are dumb companions, yet (in a sense) we may discourse with them… We may read divine truths in them, as in a book consisting of words and sentences… Not only rational and irrational, but even inanimate creatures have a voice, and speak loudly to men, and it is our duty to learn their language, and hearken to them.
To do this, Austen argues, requires that we begin seeing other creatures as more than mere means to our practical ends — a remarkably prescient case, given that half a millennium later, we still struggle to stop operationalizing creatures far closer to us on the evolutionary chain than trees. Beneath his religious language, a hallmark of his era, is a deeper message about how we commune with the universe by attending to all of its life forms so we can glean what Mary Oliver memorably called “sudden awareness of the citizenry of all things within one world.” Austen writes:
If we make use of creatures to serve our turn only in reference to our toward man, we make not half that use of them as we ought, we should study the creatures and learn from them, to bring us nearer the Creator, climbing up by them, as by step, or stairs, till we ascend to the highest good.
How much of the goodness and excellencies of God do fruit trees show forth when they (in their seasons) flourish with leaves, blossoms and fruits; especially considered not only as they appear beautiful to the eye, but also with all their inward beauties and perfections, their virtues, and uses in the life of man?
Centuries before tree-hugging became a cultural trope, Austen extols the rewards of tree-whispering as a form of contemplative practice and intimacy with our own minds:
Fruit trees discover many things of God, and many things of ourselves, and concerning our duty to God. We enquire of, and discourse with fruit trees when we consider, and meditate of them, when we search out their virtues and perfections… when we pry into their natures, and properties, that is speaking to them.
And when we (after a serious search) do make some use and result of what we see in them, when we collect something from them concerning the power, wisdom, goodness, and perfections of God, or our duty to God, that is the answer of the fruit trees; then fruit trees speak to the mind, and tell us many things, and teach us many good lessons.
Our considerations of them are the questions we put to them, and the inferences or conclusions, are their answers. Those are the lessons they teach us… Fruit trees are a Text from which may be raised many profitable doctrines… Many things may be learned from fruit trees for spiritual profit… Fruits of faith, love, joy, peace, and other fruits of the spirit, bunches of grapes, for the feeding, and refreshing of our souls…</p>

<p>Austen, who was only forty-one at the time of this treatise and by that point had already planted more than a thousand fruit trees with his own hands, draws on his experience with these silent sages to offer a number of apt metaphors for the central concerns of human life. In one passage, he explores what the grafting of fruit trees teaches us about compatibility in human relationships. Half a millennium before modern psychologists and relationship gurus began pointing to shared values as the single most important factor in lasting relationships — that is, relationships in which the partners nurture each other’s continual growth — Austen writes:
Grafts and stocks joined together of contrary, or much different natures, will not grow, nor thrive together; if they be joined in grafting, either the graft grows not at all, or else very poorly and weakly, and in a few years decays and dies; but if the kinds of trees are joined together according to rules of nature and art, then they thrive together vigorously, and bear fruits plentifully… Persons joined in any relation, they have comfort or affliction together according to their natures.
[…]
Likeness is both the cause and the bond of love.
And yet, Austen admonishes in a remarkably modern sentiment, this similarity shouldn’t be of the superficial kind — much like one wouldn’t graft two trees that have similar leaves but thrive in wholly different conditions, one shouldn’t seek a mate merely on the basis of appearance or alignment of demographic variables like class or income. He counsels:
Likeness in natures, manners, customs, begets love, and distance in these causeth dislike, and sometimes hatred… This should teach all who intend to enter into the stage of marriage, to look well into their choice, that it be upon good grounds , and not for worldly advantages in the first place, as most do, and match a soul to the earth, between which there’s no likeness, nor proportion: neither are they to look so much at likeness in the more low, and inferior respects, as person, age, birth, friends, riches, &#038;c. (though care is to be had in these) as to that great likeness, in natures, manners, habits, and principles of the mind, for these are the springs and the ties of love, therefore “be not unequally yoked together.”
In a sentiment rather ominous given its proximity in time to Henry VIII historic break with the Catholic Church in order to get the first true divorce, Austen adds:
The sad experience of many thousands may be a sufficient warning to others.
If that love flows according to that likeness of natures, then let this teach us to strive for increase of grace…
Austen seems to remind us, too, that lasting, nourishing relationships are daily work:
Every act of grace adds something to the habit, so that the habits of grace are mightily confirmed by their frequent operations.
Austen also admonishes against mistaking appearances from true grace, arguing that — like trees — the people most obsessed with the shape and style of their persona are most vacant in the substance of their personhood:
Fruit trees that bring forth the fairest and most beautiful blossoms, leaves, and shoots, they (usually) bring forth the fewest, and least fruits; because where nature is intent, and vigorously pressing to do one work (spending its strength there) it is at the same time, weak about other works; but distinct, and several works of nature, in moderate and remiss degree, are all promoted at the same time… Generally those persons who are excessive, and most curious about the forms of duties have least of the power of godliness.</p>

<p>The true test of character, Austen suggests through his arboreal metaphor, is in the fruits of our personhood — our motives, the actions they produce, and the aftertaste those leave in others — rather than in the appearance of our persona:
The fruits of trees discover plainly of what kind the trees are: the leaves and blossoms … may deceive us, but the fruits cannot deceive us, but discover manifestly of what nature the trees are… The ways, and conversations of men discover what their natures are: If men of discerning judgments will but exactly observe, and try the actions of others, they may (by degrees) conclude from what principles they act [but] from the actions and ways of some persons, a man cannot easily conclude this; vices in some are clothed in the habits of virtues.
Complement The Spiritual Use of an Orchard or Garden of Fruit Trees with a lovely children’s book based on an arboreal allegory for the human imagination, the fascinating history of visualizing human knowledge through trees, and Eve Ensler’s beautiful meditation on how trees lead us back to ourselves.</p>

  <p>“To understand the Dalai Lama … perhaps it’s most useful to see him as a doctor of the soul.”
I think a great deal about the difference between routine and ritual as a special case of our more general and generally trying quest for balance — ripped asunder by the contrary longings for control and whimsy, we routinize daily life in order to make its inherent chaos more manageable, then ritualize it in order to imbue its mundanity with magic, which by definition violates the predictable laws of the universe. I suspect that our voracious appetite for the daily routines of cultural icons is fueled by a deep yearning to glean some insight on and practical help with this impossible balancing act, from people who seem to have mastered it well enough to lead happy, productive, creatively fruitful, and altogether remarkable lives.
Perhaps the most unexpected yet brilliant master of this elusive modern equilibrium is the Dalai Lama.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Dalai Lama by Manuel Bauer</p>

<p>In the altogether magnificent The Open Road: The Global Journey of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama (public library), writer Pico Iyer — who has known the beloved spiritual leader since adolescence and, by the time he began writing this book, had visited him in his exile home for nearly thirty years — describes how the Dalai Lama begins each day:
[By] nine a.m. … the Dalai Lama himself had already been up for more than five hours, awakening, as he always does, at three-thirty a.m., to spend his first four hours of the day meditating on the roots of compassion and what he can do for his people, the “Chinese brothers and sisters” who are holding his people hostage, and the rest of us, while also preparing himself for his death.
Compressed into this humble and humbling morning routine is the entire Buddhist belief that life is a “joyful participation in a world of sorrows.” This daily rite of body and spirit is the building block of the Dalai Lama’s quiet and steadfast mission to, as Iyer elegantly puts it, “explore the world closely, so as to make out its laws, and then to see what can and cannot be done within those laws.” He writes:
To understand the Dalai Lama … especially if (as in my case) you come from some other tradition, perhaps it’s most useful to see him as a doctor of the soul.
As someone deeply invested in the crucial difference between information and wisdom, I was particularly fascinated by the Dalai Lama’s information diet — that is, what daily facts he chooses to fuse with ancient wisdom in his dedication to unraveling the nature of reality and making use of it in fortifying the soul. Iyer writes:
As a longtime student of real life, ruler of his people before the age of five, he listens every morning to the Voice of America, to the BBC East Asian broadcast, to the BBC World Service — even while meditating — and devours Time and Newsweek and many other news sources (I think of how the Buddha is often depicted with one hand touching the earth, in what Buddhists call the “witnessing the earth” gesture).
And yet the Dalai Lama approaches his information diet like he does his meditation — as a deliberate practice. In that sense, “meaning diet” is far more accurate a term, for he is remarkably deliberate about which aspects of the Information Age to fold into his meaning-making mission and which to sidestep. He chooses, for instance, to avoid one of the most perilous byproducts of our era, which Susan Sontag presaged in 1977 in her famous admonition against “aesthetic consumerism.” Iyer writes:
In the Age of the Image, when screens are so much our rulers, anyone who wishes to grab our attention — and to hold it — does so by converting himself into a “human-interest story,” translating his life into a kind of fable…. Those who long to be entrusted with real consequences in our lives acquire that power increasingly by presenting themselves as fairy tales. 
The Dalai Lama, by nature and training, is in the odd position of trying to do the opposite: he comes to us to tell us that he is real, as real as his country, bleeding and oppressed, and that he lives in a world far more complex than a two-year-old’s cries of “Good Tibetans, bad Chinese” (the Dalai Lama would more likely say, “Potentially good Tibetans, potentially good Chinese”).</p>

<p>The Dalai Lama by Manuel Bauer</p>

<p>At the heart of this message is a larger testament to the most essential characteristic of reality — something Alan Watts, who began popularizing Eastern philosophy in the West when the Dalai Lama was still a teenager, captured memorably when he wrote: “Life and Reality are not things you can have for yourself unless you accord them to all others.”
Indeed, contacting this interconnectedness of all beings and all lives is the very impetus for the Dalai Lama’s morning routine and his information diet — a beautiful assurance that beneath our obsession with routine and ritual lies a deeper, more expansive longing for meaning, for orienting ourselves in this vibrating universe of interconnectedness that we call reality.
Iyer articulates this elegantly:
Imagine, for a moment, that you are a body (not difficult to do, since in part that is what you are). You have eyes, ears, legs, hands, and, if you are lucky, all of them are in good working order. You never, if you are sane, think of your finger as an independent entity (though you may occasionally say, “My toe seems to have a mind of its own”). You are never, in your right mind, moved to hit your own foot, let alone sever it; the only loser in such an exercise would be yourself.
[…]
This is all simplistic to the point of self-evidence. But when the Buddhist speaks of “interdependence” (the central Buddhist concept of shunyata, often rendered as “emptiness,” the Dalai Lama has translated as “empty of independent identity”), all he is really saying is that we are all a part of a single body, and to think of “I” and “you,” of the right hand’s interests being different from the left’s, makes no sense at all. It’s crazy to impede your neighbor, because he is as intrinsic to your welfare as your thumb is. It’s almost absurd to say you wish to get ahead of your colleague — it’s like your right toe saying it longs to be ahead of the left.
[…]
Perhaps it’s not surprising, then, that the Fourteenth Dalai Lama is famous for his laughter, the sudden eruption of almost helpless giggles or a high-pitched shaking of the body. Seen from the vantage point of one who meditates several hours a day, traveling to the place where everything is connected, much of our fascination with surface or with division seems truly hilarious… Talking about friends and enemies is a little like holding on to this hair on your arm and claiming it as a friend, because you see it daily, and calling the hair on your back an enemy, because you never see it at all. Talking of how you are a Buddhist and therefore opposed to the Judeo-Christian teaching is like solemnly asserting that your right nostril is the source of everything good, and your left nostril a place of evil. The doctrine of “universal responsibility” is not only universal but obvious: it’s like saying that every part of us longs for our legs, our eyes, our lungs to be healthy. If one part suffers, we all do.
Suddenly, the Dalai Lama’s morning routine and his information diet are revealed in a whole new light of meaning — they are a form of self-empowerment in the journey toward shedding self-centeredness. (Lest we forget, as another great Buddhist teacher has put it, “you first need to have an ego in order to be aware that it doesn’t exist.”)
Iyer writes:
Buddhists do not (or need not) seek solutions from outside themselves, but merely awakening within; the minute we come to see that our destinies or well-being are all mutually dependent, they say, the rest naturally follows (meditation sometimes seems the way we come to this perception, reasoning the way we consolidate it). If you believe this, human life offers you many more belly laughs daily, as the Dalai Lama exemplifies.
And there, with a good-humored smirk, Iyer reminds us that his perspective isn’t perched on a holier-than-thou branch in the tree of life but grounded in his reality as a Westerner and a writer, and thus a creature of ego trying to learn the very lesson he is channeling:
Why despair, indeed, when you can change the world at any moment by choosing to see that the person who gave your last book a bad review is as intrinsic to your well-being as your thumb is?
The Open Road is an illuminating read in its totality, propelled by Iyer’s deeply pleasurable prose. Complement it with Iyer on what Leonard Cohen knows about the art of stillness and his superb On Being conversation with Krista Tippett, in which he recounts the experience of shadowing the Dalai Lama in order to capture his inner light:</p>

  <p>(Washington State University) Washington State University Spokane scientists have grown a tiny group of brain cells that can be induced to fall asleep, wake up and even show rebound sleep after ‘staying up late.’ The study – the first to document that sleep originates in small neural networks – opens the door to deeper understanding of the genetic, molecular and electrical aspects underlying sleep disorders.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The results for the May survey are now available for you to take a look at and compare with results from previous months.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can find the new survey for June here, so please fill that out if you haven’t already.</p>

<p>Our graph maker Fedso has set colours to answers for some questions, so confusion can be avoided with the AMD/Nvidia/Intel answers which traditionally have their corporate colours associated to them. If anyone has any comments or suggestions to do with this, then make sure to leave them in the comments.</p>

<p>There have been no major changes or trends this month, so analysis will be limited to the Unique Questions this month and a couple more which I’d like to comment on. This will also most likely be the norm from now on, since there is only so much one can say about incremental changes.</p>

<p>Please click on the images to enlarge. Once enlarged, you can also cycle through them using the arrows.</p>

<p>Respondents</p>

<p>Many thanks to the 1508 people who took the time to complete this survey! That’s less than the 2362 who took the survey last time, but still over the 1000 mark which I wanted to stay above. Hopefully it will stay around that mark and hopefully we aren’t getting repeat responses and things which might cause issues.</p>

<p>Question 1 - Do you currently use Linux as your primary PC gaming platform?</p>

<p>Question 2 - Did you use Wine to play games last month?</p>

<p>Question 3 - Did you use a Windows partition for gaming last month?</p>

<p>I’m still pretty shocked this hasn’t really changed since the survey began. After all the crazy and unexpected ports we’ve had since then, I really expected at least a 5% decrease over this period and probably more. Maybe I’m just overly optimistic with this, but with all the releases which should be coming out from now until October, I still remain optimistic. Though if that kind of change doesn’t happen by then, I will be incredibly disappointed. It’s no secret that this is the figure where  I really do care about seeing changes on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>Question 4 - What distribution do you use on your primary Linux gaming PC?</p>

<p>Question 5 - What Desktop Environment do you use on your primary Linux gaming PC?</p>

<p>After being briefly overtaken by Unity as the top Desktop Environment of choice for the first time in the last results, KDE Plasma is back on top. It seems that these two are neck and neck when it comes to the Desktop Environment choices of gamers. Can’t blame people for liking KDE really. I used it as my main DE of choice for many years and have fallen in love with Plasma 5 since it’s come out.</p>

<p>Question 6 - Did you change your primary Linux gaming distribution last month?</p>

<p>Question 7 - What graphics card do you use on your primary Linux gaming PC?</p>

<p>Question 8 - Which drivers do you use for that graphics card?</p>

<p>AMD</p>

<p>Intel</p>

<p>Nvidia</p>

<p>Question 9 - What CPU do you use on your primary Linux gaming PC?</p>

<p>Question 10 - Did you exclusively buy Linux-supported games last month?</p>

<p>Question 11 - How many Linux games did you buy last month?</p>

<p>Question 12- Which of these retailers did you use to buy your Linux games last month?</p>

<p>Unique Question 1 - How do you feel about Virtual Programming ports?</p>

<p>I was quite surprised to see that only 6% strongly oppose VP ports, but I guess this just confirms the internet rule of “those who scream loudest win”, and there has been a lot of animosity surrounding Virtual Programming in the last year or so. Maybe I’ve still got my head stuck in last year and the release of The Witcher 2, but Bioshock Infinite and Spec Ops: The Line have quelled a lot of that anger since then.</p>

<p>The vast majority of people either don’t care as long as they get a game which runs well on Linux, or just see it as a good “stepping stone” towards more native ports, but obviously want to see less of them as time goes on.</p>

<p>It’s quite interesting to see that all this talk about Linux users being “ideological extremists” has been proved to be wrong time and time again in many of these survey responses. While obviously there are many who stick to their principles (and with good reason), it’s certainly far more of a mixed bag out there than many assume.</p>

<p>Unique Question 2 - What did you make of Valve’s plan for paid mods?</p>

<p>Well this certainly seemed like a huge deal at the time, potentially changing the way we buy and play games, but it disappeared as fast as it arrived. It does seem that, despite many in the Windows camp claiming that Linux users are cheapskates, Linux users would be happy to pay for certain mods under certain circumstances. The answers here roughly echo those of most gamers, with some strongly opposing, but most just disliking the way it could have been potentially exploited by big developers (or other similar reasons).</p>

<p>The release of Black Mesa recently shows that people will certainly pay for mods, not to mention stuff like Gary’s Mod and others which have been around for years. Though, presumably what Valve failed to understand is that people would pay for something big and well put together like that Half-Life remake, but not $10 for horse armour.</p>

<p>I would certainly like to see something where the best content creators can be rewarded financially (even if it’s on a voluntary basis) so they continue to make more good stuff, but also deeply resent the idea of having absolutely everything monetised and think that microtransactions and a lot of DLC already cross the line. Whatever ends up happening with this, hopefully we can get something most of us can find agreeable.</p>

<p>Final Comments</p>

<p>As always, people’s comments tend to be more interesting than raw results (at least for me) since they give far more of an an insight into our collective mindsets, motives and behaviours, so please leave comments if you feel like you have stuff to say. Surveys can be very restrictive in the sense that not everyone can always be categorised into a series of check boxes, so the comments add an extra insight which numbers can’t provide.</p>

<p>Likewise, if there is anything people feel should be improved with the survey, then please say also. This isn’t really some personal project for me, I do it because I feel it benefits the community as a whole, so naturally comments are welcome since this is your survey too (without trying to seem too corny). If it’s quite a long suggestion or expect I direct response, then I might suggest sending me a private message since I don’t always check up on the comments.</p>
