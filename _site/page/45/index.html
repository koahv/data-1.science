  <p>There’s a great new upgrade coming out for the Raspberry Pi that can provide it with power via the Ethernet connection: the Pi PoE Switch HAT. It’s an add-on board that brings the Pi Supply Switch technology together with power-over-Ethernet all in one fantastic package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      +</p>

  <p>(Cell Press) Funnel-web spider venom contains powerful neurotoxins that instantly paralyze prey (usually insects). Millions of years ago, however, this potent poison was just a hormone that helped ancestors of these spiders regulate sugar metabolism, similar to the role of insulin in humans. Surprisingly, this hormone’s weaponization – described on June 11 in the journal Structure – occurred in arachnids as well as centipedes, but in different ways.</p>

  <p>(University of Alberta) In a discovery seemingly straight from the movie ‘Jurassic World,’ University of Alberta researcher Scott Persons and alumnus Lida Xing are part of the research team that has just documented a rich fossil footprint site in central China containing tracks by several kinds of dinosaurs, including raptors. From these tracks, the team has gained new insights into how raptors moved.</p>

  <p>Jupiter was appropriately named by the Romans, who chose to name it after the king of the gods. In addition to being the largest planet in our Solar System – with two and a half times the mass of all the other planets combined – it also has the most moons of any Solar planet. So far, 67 natural satellites have been discovered around the gas giant, and more could be on the way.</p>

In this post we will take a look at eight open source, data visualization tools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    +</p>

  <p>(Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie) Human teeth have to serve for a lifetime, despite being subjected to huge forces. But the high failure resistance of dentin in teeth is not fully understood. An interdisciplinary team led by scientists of Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin has now analyzed the complex structure of dentin. At the synchrotron sources BESSY II at HZB, Berlin, Germany, and the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ESRF, Grenoble, France, they could reveal that the mineral particles are precompressed.</p>

  <p>The Planetary Society solar sail exploration called LightSail is looking good. The concept—a spacecraft designed to propel through space on beams of sunlight— pushed through by nothing but the pressure of sunlight—is making news this week with reports of a successful  solar sail deployment. This is a test mission serving as a precursor to the 2016 mission. In measuring mission success, observers were looking to the deployment of LightSail’s Mylar solar sails.</p>

  <p>Scientists have – for the first time – documented the formation of a newly learned concept inside the brain and show that it occurs in the same brain areas for everyone. The results from this study also indicate that it may be possible to use a similar approach to understand the ‘loss’ of knowledge in various brain disorders, such as dementia or Alzheimer’s disease, or due to brain injuries. The loss of a concept in the brain may be the reverse of the process that the study observed.</p>

  <p>If you want to assign blame on an overcast day, then cast your eyes on the tropics. Water vapor originating from the Earth’s tropics is transported to midlatitudes on long filaments of flowing air that intermittently travel across the world’s oceans. When these airy tendrils make landfall, they can cause severe floods and other extreme weather events. Yet despite the importance of these “atmospheric rivers” for the global water and heat cycles, the mechanism behind their formation is still a mystery.</p>

  <p>It’s technically possible for each state to replace fossil fuel energy with entirely clean, renewable energy, experts say. A new report is the first to outline how each of the 50 states can achieve such a transition by 2050. The 50 individual state plans call for aggressive changes to both infrastructure and the ways we currently consume energy, but indicate that the conversion is technically and economically possible through the wide-scale implementation of existing technologies.</p>

So far you folks have helped Slashdot three out of four of these columns, and every one has hit the Top 5 list on Opensource.com, so let’s keep this train on rolling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           +</p>

  <p>(Washington State University) Washington State University Spokane scientists have grown a tiny group of brain cells that can be induced to fall asleep, wake up and even show rebound sleep after ‘staying up late.’ The study – the first to document that sleep originates in small neural networks – opens the door to deeper understanding of the genetic, molecular and electrical aspects underlying sleep disorders.</p>

  <p>ALMA’s Long Baseline Campaign has produced a spectacularly detailed image of a distant galaxy being gravitationally lensed. The image shows a magnified view of the galaxy’s star-forming regions, the likes of which have never been seen before at this level of detail in a galaxy so remote. The new observations are far more detailed than those made using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, and reveal star-forming clumps in the galaxy equivalent to giant versions of the Orion Nebula.</p>

  <p>(Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution) For more than a decade, the scientific community has postulated that methane could be spontaneously produced by chemical reactions between hydrogen from hydrothermal vent fluid and carbon dioxide. New research by geochemists at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution is the first to show that methane formation does not occur during the relatively quick fluid circulation process, despite extraordinarily high hydrogen contents in the waters.</p>

  <p>Although treatment advances have dramatically reduced deaths from opportunistic infections related to AIDS, a new study drawing on 30 years of data from more than 20,000 patients in San Francisco suggests there is still ample room to improve. About a third – 35 percent – of AIDS patients diagnosed with their first opportunistic infection from 1997 to 2012 in that city died within five years, according to the study.</p>
