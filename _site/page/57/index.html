>Credit CybherHades via Flickr CC When scientists develop a full quantum computer, the world of computing will undergo a revolution of sophistication, speed and energy efficiency that will make even our beefiest conventional machines seem like Stone Age clunkers by comparison. But, before that happens, quantum physicists like the ones in UC Santa Barbara&#8217;s physics professor John Martinis&#8217; lab will have to create circuitry that takes advantage of the marvelous computing prowess promised by the quantum bit (&#8220;qubit&#8221;), while compensating for its high vulnerability to environmentally-induced error. In what they are calling a major milestone, the researchers in the Martinis Lab have developed quantum circuitry that self-che...

Scientists have been searching for answers to why this vast water supply left the surface. “Our study provides a solid estimate of how much water Mars once had, by determining how much water was lost to space,” said Geronimo Villanueva, a scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of the new paper. “With this work, we can better understand the history of water on Mars.” Perhaps about 4.3 billion years ago, Mars would have had enough water to cover its entire surface in a liquid layer about 45...
