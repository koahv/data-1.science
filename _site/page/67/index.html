  <p>The CMBR data referenced in the study (Credit: European Space Agency)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the theory goes; some 14 billion years ago, there was “nothing” focalized in a single, highly-dense point. Then, that “nothing” exploded, hurling the ingredients for everything we see in the universe into existence. On paper, it sounds insane. Heck, it kind of IS insane, but we have several pieces of solid (but not irrefutable) evidence that show not only could it have happened this way, but that it probably did. 
One such proof comes in the form of the “Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation,” (CMB or CMBR) the after-glow of the big bang, if you will. It gives us an opportunity to understand the very first moments following the creation of the universe, yet it also poses many tantalizing mysteries that threaten to unhinge the very fabric on which we believe the universe was formed.
Before we go into those, let’s first explore what the CMBR is. Amazingly, this story has a crappy start.</p>

<p>    THE CMBR &amp; HOW IT WAS FOUND:
In 1965, before two scientists, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, started measuring radio signals as they bounced from balloon satellites for NASA’s “Project Echo,” they needed to take preventive measures to make sure the data they collected was completely incorruptible. 
The most important (and relevant) task was removing each and every potential source of interference (like radio and television broadcasting signals and those signals emitted from ground-based radars). They also erred on the side of caution by cooling their equipment down to −269 °C (only 4 K above absolute zero) to make sure that heat from the receiver wouldn’t cast any doubt on the veracity of their findings. Given the numerous variables that could go wrong, the men weren’t too perplexed when they heard a low, but steady hum coming from their receiver. 
Believing this sound to be a fluke, they once again checked their work; leading them to clean out pigeon droppings that had collected in the antennae they were using, which had been singled out as the primary source of the problem. Once finished, the signal persisted. Moreover, they discovered that it was much stronger than they had originally realized. It was also being emitted uniformly throughout space and it couldn’t be attributed to any object on Earth, or within our galaxy. As it turns out, they caught the first glimpse of the CMBR.</p>

<p>     THE ANOMALIES:
Decades after the background radiation was uncovered, NASA launched the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) to literally probe the CMBR. To put it lightly, the things they found were astounding. Some of those findings included:</p>

<p>The age of the universe within 1 percent accuracy
Its composition (the universe is made up of 72% Dark Energy and 23% Dark Matter. “Normal” matter only makes up about 4.6 percent of the over-all mass of the universe).
The matter makeup was much different in the early universe. Dark matter dominated, but dark energy didn’t exist in high quantities.
It’s highly probable that the universe is flat in geometry (rather than curved, like Earth)
Neutrinos, the crazy, shape-shifting particles, are far more numerous than suspected. They also played a significant role in the early development of the universe.</p>

<p>Those findings weren’t all that unexpected, but WMAP (and the newer “Planck”Observatory) found various things that can’t be explained using conventional models. Several of which are,</p>

<p>THE CMBR COLD SPOT:</p>

<p>The cold spot seen in the CMB map (Image Credit: Rudnick/NRAO/AUI/NSF via wikimediacommons)</p>

<p>When looking at the data collected by WMAP, scientists noticed that, in one distant region of space — toward the constellation of Eridanus (about ten billion light-years from Earth) — the CMBR showed evidence of a large “hole” in space. They aren’t traditional holes, mind you, but spots where the temperature in the CMBR varies from the usual temperature of 2.7° above absolute zero. One theory attributes this to the existence of a “supervoid.” This would be the largest one in existence, with it stretching out about one billion light-years in diameter. (For the sake of comparison, a void found in the constellation of Boötes — sometimes called the Great Void — extends somewhere between 250 and 330 million light-years in diameter, which makes it one of the largest voids we’ve found so far.)
Interestingly, not only is this region very cold, but it’s also lacking in all types of matter, including normal matter (stars, planets, galaxies and even the most basic material, like gas and dust) and even dark matter itself is strangely absent. Some astronomers suggest that the Eridanus cold spot is merely an arbitrary ‘data artifact’ that means nothing, but the Planck findings cast doubt on that notion. So if it does indeed exist (and it does), how did it form? 
Well, the most plausible solution posits that the “hole” was created as CMB microwaves made their way across the universe, to Earth, encountering many regions that (like the hole itself) were lacking in stellar material. The inter-galactic journey through these regions affected them in the opposite way that traveling through hot, dense galaxy clusters tends to inflict on said microwaves. Instead of accumulating energy through the pull of gravity, when they pass through a void, they do not gain additional energy, thus the temperature recorded in the CMB is noticeably cooler. 
Now, for some of the more fringe hypotheses: other physicists have suggested that the void is an imprint of a parallel universe. This view <em>might</em> supported by the recent discovery of a corresponding void located in the opposite hemisphere of the CMB (at least according to Laura Mersini-Houghton; a noted advocate of the landscape multiverse hypothesis). Another physicist purported that it could be a universe-in-mass black hole (but that claim is dubious at best, even if it would provide a source of all of the missing matter in the universe). The void appears to have shed uncertainty over various standard cosmology models, which say that such large-scale structures (like this enormous void) shouldn’t exist as the universe should be, more or less, the same everywhere we look. Either way, one thing is for sure. When we see such a blatant, huge area that doesn’t fit the bill, notions about the universe get shaken up very quickly and a lot of new questions demand answers.; answers that will be controversial, regardless of all else. </p>

<p>PENROSE’S CONCENTRIC CIRCLES:</p>

<p>The big bang isn’t the only model dealing with the origin of the universe. One of the more fascinating theories centers around an anomaly found in the CMBR. The theory – called “conformal cyclic cosmology“ - was developed by Sir Roger Penrose, a physicist from the University of Oxford. He believes that our universe is not the first, nor will it be the last, universe to crop up from a big bang.</p>

<p>Image Credit: Gurzadyan and Penrose (Source)</p>

<p>“Conformal cyclic cosmology” suggests that our big bang theory is far too incomplete to be viable. It doesn’t offer an explanation as to why the initial conditions of the universe were geared toward a low-entropy, highly ordered state. That is, UNLESS things were set in motion prior to the “bang” in the big bang. Moreover, when our universe starts to head toward its own end, it will divert back into the universe it was originally, before starting anew. We can thank the general nature of black holes for this, but
But Why? 
Well.. As you’ve all probably heard someone say, black holes are the vacuum cleaners of the universe (a claim that is a misnomer, by the way) ; they consume obects that come to close and gradually rid the universe of entropy. Yet they, like all things, eventually meet their end. A lot of things happen in the window of time separating the end from the beginning, like collisions.
When black holes come too close and crash into each other, they release gravitational waves; a phenomenon that sees spacetime become distorted like ripples in a pond. It has been theorized that the big bang itself should have produced gravitational waves (an assertion that was recently confirmed and then challenged soon after), which could potentially be picked up in the CMBR data, opening the door for us to witness the aftermath if only we knew what to look for. Like, in this case, curling in the polarization of the light in the CMB. 
With all of that in mind: as we said before, all temperature variations in the CMB data would be completely random. In yet another example of the opposite being found, Penrose — along his partner Vahe Gurzadyan, who hails from the Yerevan Physics Institute in Armenia — have found several concentric circles in the CMB — places where temperature variations formulate patterns stashed among the warmer regions. They believe these circles are indicative of black hole collisions in the universe that collapsed to form our own (so they are effectively giving us information about the universe before the big bang). 
If the men are right, someday in the far, far future — when the universe will no longer be able to expand any further — entropy will digress back to its original state, before the universe collapses in on itself and rebounds, ushering in a new big bang. When that happens, the gravitational waves from our universe might be recorded in the new CMB, allowing a new epoch of aliens to ponder the same questions we currently have no answers to.</p>

<p>DARK FLOW:</p>

<p>Another anomaly promised empirical evidence that we live in a multiverse (it says that we inhabit one universe in an infinite number of other ones). The CMBR data revealed that more than one hundred galaxy clusters are not only lit up by hot, x-ray emitting gases, but are also speeding off in the same direction, leading away from our solar system (toward the constellations of Centaurus and Hydra).  
The clusters seem to be traveling more than 2 million miles per hour, into an expanse of about 20-degrees of sky. Furthermore, the trend is not a statistical fluke, as it continues to hold steady throughout interstellar space instead of bucking black to normal speeds and distributions. Once again, our theories say this should be impossible. The kickback from the big bang should affect galaxies in the same, predictable manner. Especially if the galaxies are moving relative to the faint background glow left behind after the big bang. To get to the root of the problem, WMAP tested this using something called the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (SV) effect.
 Our theories on the CMB basically say that the waves that sprung from the big bang should pass through said galaxy clusters and change in predictable ways under certain scenarios, including if the galaxy is moving relative to the background glow. The WMAP was developed to test this, which is known as kinematic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (SV) effect, but physicists found something else altogether that brought more questions to light than it answered. Learning that “it’s the same flow at a distance of a hundred million light-years as it is at 2.5 billion light-years and it points in the same direction and the same amplitude. It looks like the entire matter of the universe is moving from one direction to the next,” says Alexander Kashlinsky, the team leader of the study from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. 
As a point of contention, Plank found no solid evidence to support the “preferential direction” part, but given its impact on the validity our measurements, the debacle remains shrouded in controversy. If it does exist, it too could allude to the existence of parallel universes (with both exerting mutual gravitational influence) that bump into our own.</p>

<p> THE “AXIS OF EVIL:”</p>

<p>Several years back, astronomers discovered an anomaly that has been given the silliest nickname in the history of physics (maybe with the exception of the God particle): the so-called “axis of evil.” Named as such because of the striking fact that something like this was discovered at all (statistical fluke, or not). First, to reiterate, astronomers know that any variations in temperature in the CMB data should be entirely random; however, in another instance that contradicts that line of thought, NASA’s WMAP showed us that macroscopically, there is an asymmetrical pattern that divides the universe (at least according to the CMB) into two distinct sections, with each side having a different temperature relative to the other.
Of all the anomalies, this one incited the most controversy, with many physicists believing either the axis of evil didn’t really exist, or that it could be explained in an extremely simple manner — perhaps WMAP’s instruments were miscalibrated, or maybe the axis is merely an illusion, mere distortions caused by a nearby supercluster — without having to rework our understanding of anything, but later research seemed to provide a decent amount of support for its existence. In one independent study, led by Damien Hutsemékers of the University of Liège in Belgium, scientists analyzed the light from 355 quasars, looking at their polarization, in particular, seeing that once the light wanders near the axis in question, its polarization inexplicably becomes more ordered, with it seemingly ‘corkscrewing’ around the axis.
In another investigation, when observing 1660 spiral galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, an astronomer noted that the axes on which galaxies rotate also seemingly align with the axis of evil. Statistically, this happening based on chance alone is merely 0.04 percent likely.</p>

<p>Alignment of Axis of Evil (Image Credit: Roen Kelly, Dragan Huterer)</p>

<p>According to Michael Longo (from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor), “This suggests the axis is real, and not simply an error in the WMAP data.” And for that fact, “We can be extremely confident that these anomalies are not caused by galactic emissions and not caused by instrumental effects, because our two instruments see very similar features.”
Now, here’s where it gets super weird. The CMB data seems to indicate that not only is there is some kind of a preferred direction for light in space to travel in — a conclusion based on the fact that certain galaxy clusters are speeding off at more than 2 billion kilometers per hour, all traveling toward an expanse of space that, relative to Earth, is merely 20 degrees in size (see above) — but this direction appears to correspond with the curvy “line” dividing temperature lobes in the CMB (and interestingly, it also seemingly coincides with the ecliptic plane of our solar system )
As for the “how” and “why,” astronomers posit that the axis of evil might indicate that there are issues with how we incorporate inflation — the period when the universe expanded exponentially in size in fractions of a second — into the big bang theory. Our models say that this expansion should have happened simultaneously in all directions, but what if it actually expanded more in one direction? And what if this is the reason for the abnormality? 
“Provided inflation stops at a relatively early point, this would leave traces of the early [unevenness] in the form of the axis of evil,” according to one physicist.</p>

<p>    In Conclusion:
Since these strange features were first witnessed in the CMBR by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), opinions in the scientific community have been divided. When asked whether or not “there are potential deviations from ΛCDM within the context of the allowed parameter ranges of the existing WMAP observations,’ they answered with a resounding “no,” but some of the naysayers have since changed their tune, following the release of data collected on the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background by the ESA’s Planck Space Observatory. Still, as one researcher put it, “Human eyes and brains are excellent at detecting visual patterns, but poor at assessing probabilities.” 
However, as the quantum world constantly reminds us, probability is a key part of the foundation of the universe. </p>

<p>See How Opinions Have Shifted over the Years:</p>

<p>APRIL 11, 2007 — ‘Axis of evil’ a Cause for Cosmic Concern?</p>

<p>“Some astronomers have suggested straightforward explanations for the axis, such as problems with WMAP’s instruments or distortions caused by a nearby supercluster (New Scientist, 22 October 2005, p 19). Others doubt the pattern’s very existence. “There’s still a fair bit of controversy about whether there’s even something there that needs to be explained,” says WMAP scientist Gary Hinshaw of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.”</p>

SEPTEMBER 16, 2009 — Cosmic Cold Spot Just a Trick of the Light</p>

<p>“We trace this apparent discrepancy to the fact that WMAP cold spot’s temperature profile just happens to favor the particular profile given by the wavelet.” “We find no compelling evidence for the anomalously cold spot in WMAP at scales between 2 and 8 degrees.”</p>

FEBRUARY 9, 2010 — Seven-Year WMAP Results: No, They’re NOT Anomalies:
Since the day the first Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data were released, in 2003, all manner of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anomalies have been reported; there’s been the cold spot that might be a window into a parallel universe, the “Axis of Evil”, pawprints of local interstellar neutral hydrogen, and much, much more. But do the WMAP data really, truly, absolutely contain evidence of anomalies, things that just do not fit within the six-parameters-and-a-model the WMAP team recently reported? In a word, no.

<p>“Planck reveals that one half of the universe has bigger variations than the other. Planck’s detectors are over 10 times more sensitive and have about 2.5 times the angular resolution of WMAP’s, giving cosmologists a much better look at this alignment. “We can be extremely confident that these anomalies are not caused by galactic emissions and not caused by instrumental effects, because our two instruments see very similar features.”</p>

MARCH 09, 2014 — Is the Lopsided Universe Telling Us We Need New Theories?</p>

Due to Io’s rapid rotation, each night shows a different area of the surface. The outburst waned in brightness on August 30th and September 1st, 3rd, and 10th.<br />Katherine de Kleer / UC Berkeley / Gemini Observatory / AURAImke de Pater (University of California, Berkeley) discovered the first two outbursts on August 15, 2013, using one of the 10-meter telescopes at Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The brighter one, at a previously known eruption site named Rarog Patera, was calculated to have covered 50 square miles with a lava flow 30 feet thick. The other, at Heno Patera, spewed molten rock over roughly 120 square miles. Both had abated by the time de Pater checked again five days later.But the real fireworks were yet to come. A third, even brighter eruption flared to life on August 29th and was captured simultaneously with the nearby Gemini North telescope and NASA’s Infrared Telescope Facility on Mauna Kea. The outburst was so intense and hot — even by Io’s standards — that it probably involved a cluster of towering lava fountains spread over an estimated 32 square miles. The eruption’s location, within a few degrees of 223° west, 29° north, is not associated with any <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/sim/3168/" target="_blank">previously recognized volcanic site.According to Katherine de Kleer, a UC Berkeley graduate student, the August 29th event unleashed an estimated 20 terawatts of energy, making it at least 10,000 times more powerful than the lava fountains spewed during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_eruptions_of_Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull" target="_blank">2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland.These near-infrared observations kicked off a year-long scrutiny of Io by de Kleer, de Pater, and two collaborators.

class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The Jovian moon Io is a dynamic world where volcanoes erupt continuously, staining the surface with red and yellow allotropes of sulfur. Taken by the Galileo spacecraft in December 2000, these images reveal a fresh red ring (left), some 1,000 miles (1,500 km) across, encircling the volcano called Pele.<br />NASA / JPLThe Voyager 1 spacecraft first discovered volcanoes on Io during its 1979 flyby. Since then observations with spacecraft and ground-based telescopes have shown that this moon erupts nearly constantly, making it the most volcanic body in the solar system. About 150 sites are active now, and the total count is roughly 400. Researchers believe Io’s eruptions mimic the kinds of volcanic activity that shaped the inner planets, including Earth, in the early solar system.For details about last year’s trio of powerful eruptions, see the press releases from <a href="http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2014/08/04/a-hellacious-two-weeks-on-jupiters-moon-io/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley and <a href="http://www.gemini.edu/node/12233" target="_blank">Gemini Observatory.&lt;hr

  <p>(Science China Press) Researchers worldwide recognize the woodpecker’s body functions as an excellent anti-shock organism; its brain can bear deceleration of 1,200 g during rapid pecking. This relates to its unique morphology and ability to absorb impact energy.  Using computed tomography and the construction of high-precision 3-D models of the woodpecker, Chinese scientists explain its anti-shock biomechanical structure in terms of energy distribution and conversion. These findings could guide the design of anti-shock devices and structures for humans.</p>

What we perceive as the big bang, physicists at the Perimeter Institure argue, could be the three-dimensional “mirage” of a collapsing star in a universe profoundly different than our own. Conventional understanding holds that the big bang began with a singularity – an unfathomably hot and dense phenomenon of spacetime where the standard laws of physics break down. Singularities are bizarre, and our understanding of them is limited.
Our universe may have emerged from a black hole in a higher-dimensional universe, proposed a trio of Perimeter Institute researchers in the cover story of the latest Scientific American. “Cosmology’s greatest challenge is understanding the big bang itself,” write Perimeter Institute faculty member, Niayesh Afshordi.
The big bang poses a big question: if it was indeed the cataclysm that blasted our universe into existence 13.7 billion years ago, what sparked it?
Three Perimeter Institute researchers have a new idea about what might have come before the big bang. It’s a bit perplexing, but it is grounded in sound mathematics, testable, and enticing enough to earn the cover story in Scientific American, called “The Black Hole at the Beginning of Time.”
 

 
“For all physicists know, dragons could have come flying out of the singularity,” Afshordi says in an interview with Nature.
The problem, as the authors see it, is that the big bang hypothesis has our relatively comprehensible, uniform, and predictable universe arising from the physics-destroying insanity of a singularity. It seems unlikely. So perhaps something else happened. Perhaps our universe was never singular in the first place.
Their suggestion: our known universe could be the three-dimensional “wrapping” around a four-dimensional black hole’s event horizon. In this scenario, our universe burst into being when a star in a four-dimensional universe collapsed into a black hole.
In our three-dimensional universe, black holes have two-dimensional event horizons – that is, they are surrounded by a two-dimensional boundary that marks the “point of no return.” In the case of a four-dimensional universe, a black hole would have a three-dimensional event horizon.
In their proposed scenario, our universe was never inside the singularity; rather, it came into being outside an event horizon, protected from the singularity. It originated as – and remains – just one feature in the imploded wreck of a four-dimensional star.
The researchers emphasize that this idea, though it may sound “absurd,” is grounded firmly in the best modern mathematics describing space and time. Specifically, they’ve used the tools of holography to “turn the big bang into a cosmic mirage.” Along the way, their model appears to address long-standing cosmological puzzles and – crucially – produce testable predictions.
Of course, our intuition tends to recoil at the idea that everything and everyone we know emerged from the event horizon of a single four-dimensional black hole. We have no concept of what a four-dimensional universe might look like. We don’t know how a four-dimensional “parent” universe itself came to be.
But our fallible human intuitions, the researchers argue, evolved in a three-dimensional world that may only reveal shadows of reality.
They draw a parallel to Plato’s allegory of the cave, in which prisoners spend their lives seeing only the flickering shadows cast by a fire on a cavern wall.
“Their shackles have prevented them from perceiving the true world, a realm with one additional dimension,” they write. “Plato’s prisoners didn’t understand the powers behind the sun, just as we don’t understand the four-dimensional bulk universe. But at least they knew where to look for answers.”

  <p>Dark matter is a mysterious type of matter that doesn’t interact with any form of electromagnetic radiation, i.e., light. It doesn’t radiate light, and light doesn’t bounce off it. Although we’ve never detected dark matter directly, a large amount of evidence points to its existence.Evidence for Dark MatterFritz Zwicky first proposed the idea in the 1930s, when he was observing the nearby and populous Coma galaxy cluster. By observing the light these galaxies emitted, Zwicky estimated the total mass of the cluster. But when he measured the galaxies’ velocities, Zwicky discovered that they were moving so fast that the cluster should have been breaking apart: the gravitational pull of its mass was too small in comparison.It seemed unlikely that Zwicky had caught this cluster in the act of coming apart. Instead, something other than the galaxies’ observable matter was contributing significantly to the total mass of the cluster and holding it together. Zwicky suggested that there must be some kind of unseen matter at work here: matter that produced observable gravitational effects, but did not radiate like normal matter.Further evidence for dark matter came from individual galaxies’ rotation curves, plots that compare the velocities at which stars orbit around their galaxies’ centers with the stars’ distances from the galactic center. The stars on the outskirts orbit so fast, they shouldn’t be bound to the galaxies — but they are. If our understanding of gravity is correct, these stars’ velocities can only be explained if there is an unobserved source of mass in the galactic halo.&lt;div

class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The dark matter concentrations in the galaxy cluster Abell 1689 are tinted blue. Astronomers determined the location of those concentrations from gravitational lensing.<br />NASA, ESA, and D. Coe (NASA JPL/Caltech and STScI)Cosmologists also suspect dark matter exists because of gravitational lensing. As the light from a distant galaxy travels towards Earth, it has to pass by other cosmic structures, such as galaxy clusters. When the light passes such a cluster, the cluster’s strong gravitational field acts like a lens, bending and magnifying the distant galaxy’s light. The image of the background galaxy might smear into an arc, a ring of light, or separate into multiple images. Because the amount of distortion depends on the foreground cluster’s mass, astronomers can use this gravitational lensing to measure the mass in nearby galaxy clusters. And invariably, the mass measured turns out to be far more than expected from the cluster’s emitted light.Fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) — the radiation left over from the Big Bang — provide further evidence for dark matter. Cosmologists’ can calculate <a href="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_matter.html" target="_blank">the density and composition of the universe by using these fluctuations. Using observations from ESA’s Planck spacecraft, these calculations show that atoms only constitute 4.9% of the total energy and mass in the universe. Moreover, ordinary matter only accounts for 1/6 of all the matter (regular + dark) in the universe. So dark matter must make up <a href="http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2013/03/Planck_cosmic_recipe" target="_blank">about 27% of the total mass and energy in the universe.Moreover, simulations of the large-scale structure of the universe only match observations when they include dark matter. Simulations without dark matter do not produce the filament and void structures that make up the “cosmic web” of galaxy clusters we see in the universe.Nature of Dark MatterThe nature of dark matter is still up in the air. In the most widely researched model, scientists have posited that dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). These subatomic particles don’t exist within the standard model of particle physics, but physicists predicted their existence in an extension of that model known as supersymmetry. WIMPs would interact with normal matter through gravity and, very rarely, through the weak nuclear force, one of the four fundamental forces (the other three are the strong, electromagnetic, and gravitational forces).Scientists are currently attempting to find WIMPs directly, using detectors in underground mines, or indirectly, by the gamma rays the particles should emit when annihilating. (The latter would require that a WIMP particle be its own antiparticle: matter + antimatter = <em>poof</em>.) However, recent non-detections, such as those reported from LUX, superCDMS, and the Large Hadron Collider, have had scientists looking at ever more complicated WIMP models.Of course, there’s also the possibility that our current understanding of gravity, Einstein’s theory of general relativity, is in serious need of revision. So far, general relativity has passed every test with flying colors, but a few astronomers and physicists are researching variations of gravity, such as Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), to see if they can negate the need for dark matter.&lt;hr

<blockquote>
  <p>Vesto Slipher’s observations of spiral nebulae in the early 20th century led him to conclude that most spirals, with the exception of a few (such as Andromeda), were receding from Earth. Edwin Hubble confirmed that the spiral nebulae were actually separate galaxies in 1925 when he discovered Cepheid variable stars in Andromeda. These pulsating stars obey a period-luminosity law—essentially, the longer the period of light variation, the brighter the star—which makes it possible to determine their distances. Hubble found that Andromeda was much too distant to be part of our galaxy, confirming what other astronomers previously suspected: the spiral nebulae were actually separate galaxies.Using data from Slipher and others, <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/a-whodunit-of-cosmic-proportions/">Georges Lemaître tentatively determined in 1927 that the more distant the galaxy, the faster it’s speeding away from us. However, he published his paper in French, and it wasn’t widely seen. Hubble independently (and with better data) published the same relation in 1929, and he’s usually given the credit for discovering what’s now called Hubble’s Law. He expressed this law in the equation v = Hod, where v is the galaxy’s speed in kilometers per second, and d is the galaxy’s distance from Earth in megaparsecs, where 1 megaparsec is 3.25 million light-years.Ho is a constant with the units kilometers per second per megaparsec. That mouthful means that,  for every megaparsec of distance between Earth and a galaxy, that galaxy’s speed in km/s increases by a constant amount. The speed is not actually the galaxy’s speed through space, but rather a measure of the expansion of space itself.Determining the exact value of Ho has proven difficult, largely because of uncertainties in measuring a galaxy’s distance. Hubble initially assigned a value of 500 km/s/Mpc, due to errors in his distance calculations, but astronomers soon narrowed it down to some value between 50 and 100 km/s/Mpc.<a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/planck-best-map-yet-of-cosmic-creation/">Currently astronomers have two conflicting values for Ho. An intensive project, using the Hubble Space Telescope to determine distances to far-flung galaxies by observing Cepheid variable stars, sets the value at 73.8 +/- 2.4 km/s/Mpc. But this value disagrees slightly with the value based on the Planck spacecraft’s measurements of the <a href="http://planck.cf.ac.uk/science/cmb" target="_blank">cosmic microwave background (CMB): 67.80 +/- 0.77. Astronomers don’t know yet why the discrepancy exists.The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/universe-expanding/">How fast is the universe expanding? appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com">Sky &amp; Telescope.</a></a></a></a></a></p>

  <p>(Phys.org) —An international research team, led by Dr. Yuji Harada from Planetary Science Institute, China University of Geosciences, has found that there is an extremely soft layer deep inside the Moon and that heat is effectively generated in the layer by the gravity of the Earth. These results were derived by comparing the deformation of the Moon as precisely measured by Kaguya (SELENE, Selenological and Engineering Explorer) and other probes with theoretically calculated estimates. These findings suggest that the interior of the Moon has not yet cooled and hardened, and also that it is still being warmed by the effect of the Earth on the Moon. This research provides a chance to reconsider how both the Earth and the Moon have been evolving since their births through mutual influence until now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given what we know about the laws that govern the universe, it seems highly unlikely (if even credible at all) that we will ever travel all the way from Earth to the far side of our galaxy, It’s even more unlikely that we will ever traverse space between stars, or feel the warmth of a star from an exoplanet in the Triangulum Galaxy. Even at “small” distances (like the distance that separates Earth from, say, Pluto). Space is unimaginably vast and it continues to grow larger by the day.
Naturally, scientists have come up with several solutions for our predicament, including functional warp drives, but there’s yet another workaround that has yet to be proven: wormholes. If you aren’t familiar with them, wormholes are highly theoretical “structures” that come in one of two main flavors:
Primary Types of Wormholes:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first type of wormholes — called intra-universe wormholes — in the simplest possible terms, can essentially be likened to anchors that tie our universe with others found within the multiverse (to put it plainly, they are portals into other universes). Such wormholes would be impregnable for normal matter and impossible to maintain without some exotic kind of matter holding the “mouth’ open.As an interesting side-note, various theoretical physicists suggest that the supermassive black holes found within the central region of most large galaxies might actually be wormholes instead. They have even proposed a way of testing this hypothesis out.</p>

<p>The second type is the one most people are familiar with; places where spacetime folds in on itself, formulating ‘bridges” that not only connect two distant points in space,  but they create shortcuts between them. You would enter the wormhole from one location and you might find yourself on the other side of the universe when you come out. It must be said that if these structures do exist — which is possible given the fact that one type of wormhole within a black holes is supported by Einstein’s theory of general relativity (at least some part of the mathematical framework is) — they still might not be traversable.
Even if some types are, you would still need to overcome some pretty difficult obstacles to make it to the other side without getting shredded into a trillion tiny pieces, or becoming incinerated by the heat.</p>

<p>Despite never having seen a wormhole, or finding definitive proof of their existence, the whole thing raises an interesting question, what would it be like to travel through a traversable wormhole and live to tell the tale? What would you see? Of course, we can’t answer that question with any certainty, but this incredible video explores the possibilities.</p>

<p>The animation, created by Andrew Hamilton — an astrophysicist from the University of Colorado, Boulder — is not based on the black hole most of you are familiar with, a Schwarzchild black hole, but a Reissner-Nordström black hole (these black holes are characterized as objects with mass and electric charge, but no spin). This distinction matters because, as Hamilton put it: “The big difference between a charged (Reissner-Nordström) and an uncharged (Schwarzschild) black hole is that the mathematical solution to the charged black hole has, inside its horizon, a one-way wormhole that connects to a white hole that propels you to another space and time.”
What Exactly Am I Seeing?
The animation, created by Andrew Hamilton — an astrophysicist from the University of Colorado, Boulder — is not based on the black hole most of you are familiar with, a Schwarzchild black hole, but a Reissner-Nordström black hole (these black holes are characterized as objects with mass and electric charge, but no spin). This distinction matters because, as Hamilton put it: “The big difference between a charged (Reissner-Nordström) and an uncharged (Schwarzschild) black hole is that the mathematical solution to the charged black hole has, inside its horizon, a one-way wormhole that connects to a white hole that propels you to another space and time.”
The following text in quotation marks come from Hamilton himself. I strongly urge you to skip the section below on our site and follow this link to read the full description for each segment of the video. It’s the only way to really absorb the information. The cliff notes:
“Outside the outer horizon, the orbital structure of the charged (Reissner-Nordström) black hole is similar to that of the uncharged (Schwarzschild) black hole, with regions where circular orbits are stable, unstable, and non-existent. But whereas the uncharged black hole had a single horizon, the charged black hole has two horizons, an outer horizon and an inner horizon. You follow a real free-fall trajectory into and through the charged black hole.”</p>

<p>Once you journey through the first horizon (the outer-most one), you soon meet the second boundary, the inner-horizon. Hamilton posits that this trip might take around 20 seconds, assuming the black hole is around the same size as the supermassive black hole looming in the central region of the Milky Way, called Sagittarius A*.
Hamilton continues, “The trip down to outer horizon of the Reissner-Nordström black hole is similar to that of a Schwarzschild black hole.” Once you completely pass through the outermost boundary, your view would essentially split in two in both scenarios. Only you wouldn’t even know that you’ve completed the journey without the grid represented in the animated GIF on the right.
At this point, your eyes would start to play tricks on you, as the interior would look like it is expanding and compressing, but it looks smaller as you continue falling inward. “The shrinking is caused by relativistic beaming, which concentrates the view ahead. The same relativistic beaming causes light from the outside universe to become brighter and more blueshifted around the black hole.”
This view changes as you enter the inner horizon. The farther you fall in, the more the inward flow of spacetime moves along, “slowed by the gravitational repulsion produced by the negative pressure of the radial electric field.’ Once you reach a certain radius, the flow of spacetime speeds back down to light speed, where you are met with all of the light and information you missed up until that point. It is now able to propagate upwards to your line of sight.</p>

<p>Image Credit: Andrew Hamilton</p>

<p>To put it another way, “if you look at your feet, you do see them below you, but in fact the feet that you see emitted their light at a time when they were outside the current position of your eyes. At the inner horizon, you are hit by an infinitely bright, infinitely energetic burst of light. The bright point of light is an image of the outside universe reflected by the gravitationally repulsive singularity. The burst of light contains, infinitely speeded up, the entire history of the universe.
 “The infinitely bright burst of light signals the breakdown of the Reissner-Nordström geometry.” “From the inner horizon on, the Reissner-Nordström geometry is not physically realistic, despite being an exact mathematical solution to Einstein’s equations.”
The grids are used to help visualize the internal makeup of the singularity, but to expand:.
“The horizon grids are colored with the blackbody color that you would see if the objects emitting at the horizon had a temperature of 4096 K and were free-falling radially from zero velocity at infinity. As you fall inward through the inner horizon, a new grid appears, marking the ingoing inner horizon. The dark red grid marking the antihorizon becomes temporarily invisible as you turn around inside the wormhole, but then reappears as you approach the inner horizon going outwards. As you pass back outward through the inner horizon, a third grid appears, the outgoing inner horizon, or inner anti-horizon.”
“As its Penrose diagram shows, the (outgoing) inner anti-horizon is not the same as the (in-going) inner horizon. As the white hole catapults you outward into a new universe, a fourth grid appears, marking the white hole’s outer horizon. Inside the inner horizon, the flow of space slows down, turns around, and accelerates you back out again, back towards the radius of inner horizon. This region inside the inner horizon is the wormhole.” </p>

<p>Artist impression of a white hole (Source Unknown)</p>

<p> Now, you finally come to the last leg of your journey. “As you pass outward through the outer horizon of the white hole, for the third time you see an infinitely bright, energetic burst of light. This time the light is from a new universe into which you have been deposited by the white hole. The burst of light contains the entire past history of the new universe.”
“Turning around and looking back, you see the white hole from which you emerged. You see light from your original Universe. The light has traversed the same journey as you, through the black hole, through the wormhole, through the white hole, into a new universe.”
However, he stresses another important point, saying that “since the Reissner-Nordström geometry is just a mathematical solution, it does not specify who or where or when the new universe is. If you like, you can imagine that the new universe might be another place and time in our own Universe. But in reality, the Reissner-Nordström geometry is not a physically consistent solution for a real black hole. In reality, there is no new universe.”</p>

<p>What If I Could Survive?
Under certain circumstances, you might be able to survive the tidal forces felt once you venture into the event horizon of the black hole itself. One of our previous articles touches base on this:
“It has been speculated that if a black hole is sufficiently large enough (say, with the diameter of our solar system), you might actually be able to survive the spaghettification process long enough to witness something truly spectacular. In short; the larger the black hole, the less extreme its surface is. Therefore, if a black hole were large enough, it would theoretically be possible to maintain your structural integrity. 
Given the basic tenets of general and special relativity — that the faster objects move through space, the slower they move through time — we can deduce that every object (including you) that was ever swallowed by the black hole would feel the effects of the time dilation brought on by the curvature of space/time. The objects that hurdled into the black hole before you did would experience a larger time dilation than you..
Conversely, the objects that will enter it after you will experience less time dilation. Thus, if you’re able to look forward toward the black hole as you’re falling into it at relativistic speeds, you would see every object that has fallen into it in the past. If you look backward, you’d be able to see everything that will ever fall into the black hole after you. You’d be able to see the entire history of that particular spot in the cosmos from the inception of the universe, until the end of time (at least until Hawking radiation causes the black hole to evaporate).”
