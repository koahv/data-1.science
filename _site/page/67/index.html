>      The first breakthrough paper to come out of a massive U.S. expedition to one of Earth’s final frontiers shows that there’s life and an active ecosystem one-half mile below the surface of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, specifically in a lake that hasn’t seen sunlight or felt a breath of wind for millions of years. “We are looking at a water column that probably has about 4,000 things we call species. It’s incredibly diverse,” said Brent Christner, associate professor of biological sciences at Louisiana State University. The life is in the form of microorganisms that live beneath the enormous Antarctic ice sheet and convert ammonium and methane into the energy required for growth. Many of the microbes are single-celled organisms know...

To combat this, I arm myself with open source software that helps me efficiently capture a lot of information.&lt;A HREF="http://www.linuxlinks.com/article/20140816112531805/AppsNotes.html"&gt;Read more&lt;/A&gt;...

#### Extract
>No longer just fantastical fodder for sci-fi buffs, cyborg technology is bringing us tangible progress toward real-life electronic skin, prosthetics and ultraflexible circuits. Now taking this human-machine concept to an unprecedented level, pioneering scientists are working on the seamless marriage between electronics and brain signaling with the potential to transform our understanding of how the brain works—and how to treat its most devastating diseases....

#### Extract
>Mining the moon to meet our energy needs may sound like the plot from a sci-fi movie, but China is considering doing exactly that. Helium 3 is an extremely valuable isotope that could be used in clean fusion plants to generate energy &#8211; and it&#8217;s available in vast quantities on the moon. Some scientists say that the moon is so rich in Helium 3 that it could solve the world&#8217;s energy problems for at least 10,000 years.
