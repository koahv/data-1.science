  <p>If you take certain atoms and make them almost as cold as they possibly can be, the atoms will fuse into a collective low-energy quantum state called a Bose-Einstein condensate. In 1968 physicist Herbert Fröhlich predicted that a similar process at a much higher temperature could concentrate all of the vibrational energy in a biological protein into its lowest-frequency vibrational mode. Now scientists in Sweden and Germany have the first experimental evidence of such so-called Fröhlich condensation.</p>

  <p>(Phys.org)—A lot of attention has been given to the differences between the quantum and classical worlds. For example, quantum entanglement, superposition, and teleportation are purely quantum phenomena with no classical counterparts. However, when it comes to certain areas of thermodynamics—specifically, thermal engines and refrigerators—quantum and classical systems so far appear to be nearly identical. It seems that the same thermodynamic laws that govern the engines in our vehicles may also accurately describe the tiniest quantum engines consisting of just a single particle.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From Hayes to Romford, Watford to Purley, and everywhere in between, electric car charger stations are dotted across the streets of London. Numbering around 1,000, this sprawling collection of fuel stations for the environmentally conscious is the largest in Europe. Those who prefer their fuel non-combustible are able to recharge their right-on electric battery powered cars at their convenience, and be on their silent way.
A new trial by the British Department for Transport, however, could soon render these electric juice points obsolete. It was announced in August that the UK government would go ahead with an 18-month trial of highways that will be able to charge electrically powered cars as they drive along.
“What has been committed to is that by 2016 or 2017 we will hold off-road trials – in other words not on a public road”, Stuart Thompson, a spokesman for Highways England told the BBC. “It’s still very early days. Where exactly the trials will be has yet to be determined.”
So far £200,000 has been spent investigating the feasibility of the technology, while it is expected another £500,000 will be spent on the plan.
Current of history
The basic idea behind the electric highway is to lay electric cables under the road. These cables will give off an electromagnetic field. Cars equipped with the correct technology will, if all goes well, pick up the electricity emitted, providing them with power to continue driving along indefinitely – or at least until they veer off the electric highway for long enough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>£200k
Spent on the Electric Highways project
£500k
Planned additional spend</p>

<p>The concept itself can be traced back to the late 19th century, being one of the many ideas of the Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla. Patenting the idea in 1894, Tesla proposed a scheme for tramcars to be powered by electric currents emitted from the ground along their route of travel. As the patent itself noted, the idea was to provide tramcars with electricity currents “without the use of sliding or rolling contacts between the line conductor and the car motors”. The electricity supply, it continued, was intended to “convey these currents… run from the stationary source of supply along the line of travel and preferably through a conduit constructed between, or alongside of the tracks or rails”. As with so many of Tesla’s bold ambitions, however, it sadly never came to fruition.
Similar technologies do, however, now exist around the world. After years of testing, in 2013 the town of Gumi, South Korea opened a 15-mile route on which specially constructed buses draw their power from under-road cables. In 2014, the British city of Milton Keynes introduced a less technologically sophisticated version to charge its own bus fleet. Rather than bury the cables under the surface (which requires digging up and relaying the road), the city opted to lay electric plates on top of the road at certain points, where buses pick up the charge as they sit above them. This does, however, require the buses to remain stationary to be charged.
Red flags and range anxiety
One major obstacle to electric cars becoming more popular is that people feel they are not very practical. A perceived lack of ease in keeping electric cars charged and running puts people off considering one, while the lack of such vehicles makes creating an infrastructure for charging them seem pointless.
“When the UK government surveyed consumers and businesses, they found the chicken-and-egg problem that haunts [electric vehicles] elsewhere”, said the website Co.Exist. “Some consumers don’t want to buy an electric car without a full infrastructure for charging in place.”
In the UK, a trip to the petrol station is routine, but outside London, the infrastructure needed to support electric cars is all but non-existent. Even inside London, the charge-up station network is shoddy. In 2014, The Telegraph pointed out that many of the charging points in London do not work, with confusion over who is responsible for their repair leaving them offline. The website Source London tracks which points are online and available for use: the map is constantly changing, but a quick glance at any given time will show a large number flagged red as inoperable. As The Telegraph said: “[T]he London Borough of Camden admits that it’s struggling to keep more than 70 percent of its charging points operational at any one time, leaving significant holes in the network.”
One Financial Times journalist recounted: “On a recent weekday morning, I walked to the nearest charging point to my home in Camberwell, southeast London, but it was out of service. So was the next one I visited, around half a mile away”.
Motorists in the UK have become accustomed to the ready availability of fuel. The idea of being uncertain whether or not the source of petrol for one’s car will be available is particularly unappealing.
All of this creates ‘range anxiety’; another major reason people have an aversion to electric cars. No one wants to get caught short, half a mile from the nearest charging point. Not that drivers in petrol powered cars are not also prone to such problems, but people have become accustomed to gauging how far they can get on low petrol before they arrive at the next station, or at least have the comfort of knowing there is an emergency jerry can of petrol in their car boot. The electric highway, if widespread enough, could alleviate such fears.
Many of the newer models of electric cars have increased battery power, allowing vehicles to run longer, easing the mind of drivers. This does not mean electric highways would be redundant, as even the longest powered battery needs to be recharged. As the electric highways themselves would require major road works to lay the cables, the highways will initially cover only certain areas, or be gradually integrated road by road. At the same time, as the BBC noted: “Highways England is also committed to installing plug-in charging points every 20 miles… on its motorway network over the ‘longer-term’.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Earlier this month Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) announced findings that the LCOE for wind and solar is now cheaper than coal and gas in Europe. Further the organization said that it is actually the renewables that are pushing up the LCOE of gas and coal. Because the BNEF analysis is so deep and complex — it uses thousands of data points the company says — the press release that it issued was hard to understand. Here we take a deeper look at the process involved in comparing energy generation technologies to determine exactly why renewables will continue to push out fossils for the foreseeable future.
First, what is LCOE? Short for levelized cost of electricity, LCOE takes all of the factors into producing a megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity into play. This includes everything from the cost of equipment, labor, permits, etc. to build the plants; the cost of fuel to run them; the cost of operations and maintenance over the lifetime of the plant; and the cost of capital to pay for everything mentioned above. All of these costs, which BNEF derived based on actual deals and projects around the world, were tallied and then divided by the by the amount of energy the plants will produce (which depends very much on capacity factor) over their lifetime to arrive at a final cost for each and every MWh of electricity that will be produced by the power plant.
It’s a very useful metric for comparing generation technologies in an apple-to-apples format. But what will be most fascinating to energy stakeholders is that renewables are now inching out fossils in some regions of the world.
Why different regions? The cost of building, operating, maintaining and fueling a coal plant in China will not be the same as building, operating, maintaining and fueling one in, for example, Europe. Similarly, the output of an onshore wind farm in a location where the wind never stops blowing will be different that the output of a wind farm in a location where the wind picks up and then dies down frequently over the course of a year.
This is why LCOE is useful – because while in a wind farm, the fuel is free, the output is much less than a coal plant, which could theoretically run 90 percent of the time (this is called its capacity factor or utilization rate). But what happens to that coal plant’s capacity factor is greatly affected by the amount of other generation available to send power to the grid. So, as more wind energy is available because there are more wind farms built, the capacity factor of that coal plant goes down: now instead of running 90 percent of the time, it runs maybe 75 percent of the time, which then pushes up its LCOE.
While we were not able to get our hands on a publishable chart before press time, a deeper look at the BNEF analysis shows not only that the LCOE for wind and solar is beating coal and natural gas in some regions of the world, but that other renewable technologies such as geothermal, biomass incineration and small hydro also have very low LCOEs and in many regions are cost competitive or cheaper than fossil or nuclear energy.
More Numbers
To get down to the nitty-gritty, specifically, the global average LCOE for onshore wind dropped from $85 per megawatt-hour in the first half of the year, to $83 in H2, while that for crystalline silicon PV solar fell from $129 to $122.
In the same period, the LCOE for coal-fired generation increased from $66 per MWh to $75 in the Americas, from $68 to $73 in Asia-Pacific, and from $82 to $105 in Europe. The LCOE for combined-cycle gas turbine generation rose from $76 to $82 in the Americas, from $85 to $93 in Asia-Pacific and from $103 to $118 in EMEA.
Seb Henbest, head of Europe, Middle East and Africa at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, commented: “Our report shows wind and solar power continuing to get cheaper in 2015, helped by cheaper technology but also by lower finance costs. Meanwhile, coal and gas have got more expensive on the back of lower utilization rates, and in Europe, higher carbon price assumptions following passage of the Market Stability Reserve reform.”
Among other low-carbon energy technologies, offshore wind reduced its global average LCOE from $176 per MWh, to $174, but still remains significantly more expensive than wind, solar PV, coal or gas, while biomass incineration saw its levelized cost stay steady at $134 per MWh. Nuclear, like coal and gas, has very different LCOE levels from one region of the world to another, but both the Americas and the Europe, Middle East and Africa region saw increases in levelized costs, to $261 and $158 per MWh respectively.
Among the country-level findings of the BNEF study are that onshore wind is now fully cost-competitive with both gas-fired and coal-fired generation, once carbon costs are taken into account, in the UK and Germany. In the UK, onshore wind comes in on average at $85 per MWh in the second half of 2015, compared to $115 for combined-cycle gas and $115 for coal-fired power; in Germany, onshore wind is at $80, compared to $118 for gas and $106 for coal.
In China, onshore wind is cheaper than gas-fired power, at $77 per MWh versus $113, but it is much more expensive still than coal-generated electricity, at $44, while solar PV power is at $109. In the US, coal and gas are still cheaper, at $65 per MWh, against onshore wind at $80 and PV at $107.
Luke Mills, analyst, energy economics at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said: “Generating costs continue to vary greatly from region to region, reflecting influences such as the shale gas boom in the U.S., changing utilization rates in areas of high renewables penetration, the shortage of local gas production in East Asia, carbon prices in Europe, differing regulations on nuclear power across the world, and contrasting resources for solar generation.
“But onshore wind and solar PV are both now much more competitive against the established generation technologies than would have seemed possible only five or 10 years ago.”

<p>The internet runs on Linux, everybody knows this fact. The Linux Kernel is one of the most complex and popular open source projects. If you wish to learn the basics, there is tons of material available online. Still, the core of the Linux kernel is a subject difficult to understand.
It’s said that a picture is worth a thousand words. In the past, we have shared two articles in the learn in faster series : Python in one image and JavaScript in one image. Along the similar lines, today we’re here with the complete Linux Kernel map.
In Linux Kernel, there are multiple layers, modules, functionalities, calls and functions – and to make everything clear, MakeLinux has a cool interactive map of the complete kernel. Here, we are sharing this interactive map of Linux Kernel that has all the components and each item on the map is an hyperlink to the source code and documentation.
This Linux kernel map helps you to understand complex interconnections between subsystems of the kernel while you navigate through its source code.

  <p>(University of British Columbia) Researchers have been able to watch the interior cells of a plant synthesize cellulose for the first time by tricking the cells into growing on the plant’s surface, according to a new paper published in Science. Cellulose, the structural component of cell walls that enables plants to stay upright, is the most abundant biopolymer on earth. It’s a critical resource for pulp and paper, textiles, building materials, and renewable biofuels.</p>

Mars turned cold and dry long ago, but researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder discovered evidence of an ancient lake that likely represents some of the last large-scale potentially habitable surface water ever to exist on the Red Planet.
The study, published in the journal Geology, examined an 18-square-mile chloride salt deposit (roughly the size of the city of Boulder) in the planet’s Meridiani region near the Mars Opportunity rover’s landing site. As seen on Earth in locations such as Utah’s Bonneville Salt Flats, large-scale salt deposits are considered to be evidence of evaporated bodies of water.
Digital terrain mapping and mineralogical analysis of the features surrounding the deposit indicate that this one-time lake bed is no older than 3.6 billion years old, well after the time period when Mars is thought to have been warm enough to sustain large amounts of surface water planet-wide. Planetary scientists believe that the solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.
“This was a long-lived lake, and we were able to put a very good time boundary on its maximum age,” said Brian Hynek, a research associate at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at CU-Boulder and lead author of the study. “We can be pretty certain that this is one of the last instances of a sizeable lake on Mars.”
Based on the extent and thickness of the salt, the researchers estimate that the lake was only about 8 percent as salty as the Earth’s oceans and therefore may have been hospitable to microbial life.
“By salinity alone, it certainly seems as though this lake would have been habitable throughout much of its existence,” said Hynek, who is also an associate professor in the Department of Geological Sciences at CU-Boulder and director of the CU Center for Astrobiology. He noted, however, that other factors such as acidity levels were not included in the scope of the study.
The University of Alaska Geophysical Institute’s Remote Sensing Laboratory and the University of Arizona’s High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) team provided assistance with digital terrain mapping and data processing. The NASA-Mars Data Analysis Program provided funding for the research.

  <p>AstroSat launched into orbit on September 28, 2015, and will soon start returning visible, ultraviolet, and X-ray images of the universe.
Launch of Astrosat atop a PSLV rocket. ISRO
Indian astrophysics got a boost recently when an Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) PSLV rocket launched from Satish Dhawan Space Center on September 28th, placing Astrosat in a low-Earth orbit inclined 6° to the equator. The multi-purpose observatory is equipped to observe the Universe across the X-ray spectrum, accompanied by simultaneous visible and ultraviolet light observations.
Previously, India has lofted X-ray detectors aboard high-altitude balloons and sub-orbital sounding rockets, but this is India’s first astronomical satellite. Data from AstroSat will be available to the Indian astronomy community via proposals for observations.
“Expectations naturally depend on the aspirations of the astronomer,” says payload manager Arikkala Raghurama Rao (Tata Institute of Fundamental Research). “Personally, I expect Astrosat to break new ground in understanding the jet emission from black holes (stellar-mass as well as supermassive black holes), the beaming geometry of pulsars, and extending the observations of short gamma-ray bursts to higher redshifts.”
With the capability of observing from visible wavelengths all the way through high-energy X-rays, Astrosat will also be capable of studying everything from nearby white dwarfs, pulsars, and supernova remnants to faraway galaxy clusters.
From Visible Light to X-rays
Astrosat / Indian Space Research Organization
Astrosat carries five astronomical instruments that observe the sky in five different wavelength ranges, from visible through near- and far-ultraviolet, to low-energy and high-energy X-rays.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) is a twin optical system, each primary mirror 37.5 centimeters in diameter and in a Ritchey-Chrétien configuration. Think of the UVIT payload as a set of binoculars in space, with each ocular about twice the size of a backyard 8-inch diameter Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. The primary purpose of this instrument is to accompany X-ray observations with simultaneous visible, near-, and far-ultraviolet images, covering 130 to 530 nanometers.
The Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) focuses “soft” X-rays (that is, low-energy X-rays between 300 and 8,000 electron Volts) into images from which low-resolution spectra can also be extracted. Its design is similar to the Swift’s X-ray Telescope.
The Large Area Xenon Proportional Counters (LAXPC) are three block-shaped detectors that collect X-rays with higher energies, between 3,000 and 80,000 eV. Unlike the SXT, this instrument doesn’t focus X-rays into images, but it does provide incredibly precise arrival times for each photon. Astronomers can also reconstruct low-resolution spectra from the data LAXPC collects.
The Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride Imager (CZTI) collects X-ray photons with even higher energies, up to 150,000 eV. While it also doesn’t focus X-rays, this instrument can carry out polarization measurements, a capability lacking on most other X-ray telescopes.
The Scanning Sky Monitor (SSM), a detector with a huge 10° by 90° field of view, which will scan the sky for transient X-ray sources. Its design is much like the decommissioned Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE).</p>

<p>Another auxiliary payload aboard Astrosat is a Charged Particle Monitor (CPM), which counts charged particles to protect the satellite’s instruments, particularly when the spacecraft passes through the South Atlantic Anomaly region, an area of high electron and proton flux.
New Capabilities
AstroSat in the clean room. The triple tubes are the SXT and two UVIT detectors, while the three boxes stowed around them are the LAXPC.  ISRO
Astrosat joins several other X-ray observatories already in orbit: Chandra makes out fine details in low-energy X-ray images, NuSTAR brings high-energy X-rays into sharp focus, Swift monitors the sky for distant explosions bright in X-rays and gamma rays, and the European Space Agency’s (ESA) XMM-Newton is a light bucket that can measure X-ray spectra of faint sources. So what does Astrosat bring to the table?
Kulinder Pal Singh (Tata Institute for Fundamental Research) compares Astrosat to a combination of the Swift satellite and the now-retired Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite (RXTE). Like Swift, Astrosat will hunt for X-ray transients and observe these sources across the visible-to-X-ray spectrum. And like RXTE, LAXPC’s triplet of detectors will measure the arrival time of each photon. LAXPC has the largest collecting area of any X-ray instrument ever built, and it’s currently the only one capable of studying X-ray fluctuations over millisecond timescales.
The satellite is now undergoing systems checks: the CPM and CZTI are now operational, and Singh says we can expect to see Astrosat’s first images about 6 to 8 weeks post-launch. The satellite has an expected lifetime of at least five years.
By the way, NORAD cataloged Astrosat as ID 2015-052A/40930 shortly after launch, but unfortunately for northern satellite spotters, Astrosat’s low-inclination orbit makes it visible only from Earth’s equatorial regions due to its low inclination orbit.
The Indian Space Research Organization has proven itself a force to be reckoned with thanks to recent success stories, including the Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter and the Mars Orbiter Mission, which successfully entered orbit around the Red Planet on September 24, 2014. (It’s worth noting that India is the only nation that was successful in fielding a mission to Mars on its first try!)
Now we can add Astrosat to India’s list of space success stories, one that holds a promise of some exciting astrophysics discoveries to come.

  <p>Researchers have developed a new method for measuring the mass of pulsars - highly magnetized rotating neutron stars formed from the remains of massive stars after they explode into supernovae. Until now, scientists have determined the mass of stars, planets and moons by studying their motion in relation to others nearby, using the gravitational pull between the two as the basis for their calculations. However, in the case of young pulsars, mathematicians have now found a new way to measure their mass, even if a star exists on its own in space.</p>

NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft has returned the best color and the highest resolution images yet of Pluto’s largest moon, Charon – and these pictures show a surprisingly complex and violent history. At half the diameter of Pluto, Charon is the largest satellite relative to its planet in the solar system. Many New Horizons scientists expected Charon to be a monotonous, crater-battered world; instead, they’re finding a landscape covered with mountains, canyons, landslides, surface-color variations and more.
“We thought the probability of seeing such interesting features on this satellite of a world at the far edge of our solar system was low,” said Ross Beyer, an affiliate of the New Horizons Geology, Geophysics and Imaging (GGI) team from the SETI Institute and NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, “but I couldn’t be more delighted with what we see!”
High-resolution images of the Pluto-facing hemisphere of Charon, taken by New Horizons as the spacecraft sped through the Pluto system on July 14, and transmitted to Earth on Sept. 21, reveal details of a belt of fractures and canyons just north of the moon’s equator. This great canyon system stretches across the entire face of Charon, more than a thousand miles, and probably around onto Charon’s far side. Four times as long as the Grand Canyon, and twice as deep in places, these faults and canyons indicate a titanic geological upheaval in Charon’s past.
 </p>

<p> 
“It looks like the entire crust of Charon has been split open,” said John Spencer, deputy lead for GGI at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. “In respect to its size relative to Charon, this feature is much like the vast Valles Marineris canyon system on Mars.”
The team has also discovered that the plains south of the canyon, informally referred to as Vulcan Planum, have fewer large craters than the regions to the north, indicating that they are noticeably younger. The smoothness of the plains, as well as their grooves and faint ridges, are clear signs of wide-scale resurfacing.
One possibility for the smooth surface is a kind of cold volcanic activity, called cryovolcanism. “The team is discussing the possibility that an internal water ocean could have frozen long ago, and the resulting volume change could have led to Charon cracking open, allowing water-based lavas to reach the surface at that time,” said Paul Schenk, a New Horizons team member from the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.
Even higher-resolution Charon images and composition data are still to come as New Horizons transmits data, stored on its digital recorders, over the next year – and as that happens, “I predict Charon’s story will become even more amazing!” said mission Project Scientist Hal Weaver, of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.
The New Horizons spacecraft is currently 3.1 billion miles (5 billion kilometers) from Earth, with all systems healthy and operating normally.
New Horizons is part of NASA’s New Frontiers Program, managed by the agency’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. APL designed, built, and operates the New Horizons spacecraft and manages the mission for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. SwRI leads the science mission, payload operations, and encounter science planning.

  <p>Planetary scientist Alan Stern continues his exclusive series of blogs with details of what awaits the New Horizons spacecraft when it reaches its next objective.
It sounds like science fiction, but it’s not: NASA’s New Horizons mission explored the Pluto system this summer — and we’re not done yet! For the next year, New Horizon will be downloading data virtually daily from its encounter with Pluto and its moons. We will also be making preparations for our next flyby, which will explore an ancient, intermediate-size Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) called 2014 MU69.
Its Pluto flyby now over, New Horizons is moving farther from the Sun and deeper into the Kuiper Belt. Dan Durda
When the National Academy of Sciences’ 2003 Planetary Decadal Survey rocketed the exploration of Pluto to the top of NASA’s science budget queue, it also made very clear that the mission was to be a broader approach than simply a Pluto flyby and should include one or more flybys of KBOs 30 to 50 km in diameter. In fact, the Decadal Survey’s drafters felt so strongly about this that they dubbed the mission “Kuiper Belt Pluto Flyby.” NASA managers felt the same way, ultimately requiring us to build a spacecraft and payload fully capable of operating all the way out to at least 55 astronomical units (8¼ billion km) from the Sun — and to carry the fuel necessary to conduct at least one flyby of an ancient KBO far beyond Pluto.
The motivation for studying small KBOs is straightforward. These bodies are valuable for understanding the accretion of distant small planets like Pluto, Eris, Makemake, Haumea, Sedna, and their siblings. Why is that? It’s because KBOs of this size are thought to be the building blocks that led to these larger bodies. And because medium-size KBOs are both about 1,000 times more massive than comets like 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (which Rosetta is studying up close) and yet still 1,000 to 10,000 times less massive than Pluto, their study can help connect the dots of the accretion 4½ billion years ago of the small planets now found abundantly throughout our solar system.
Our target, 2014 MU69 (initially dubbed “PT1” for Potential Target 1), was found in 2014 by the Hubble Space Telescope as part of a dedicated search for New Horizons KBO targets. Actually, HST found several potential targets, but this one was selected for several reasons. One is that it is the most accessible — New Horizons will need the least fuel and shortest flight time to reach it. But 2014 MU69 also hits the sweet spot scientifically. It’s about 45 km across (assuming a 4% surface reflectivity), and it’s a member of the “cold, classical” dynamical population of objects that formed right there in the Kuiper Belt directly from the primordial solar nebula.
New Horizons must travel a billion miles past Pluto to reach 2014 MU69 (initially designated PT1). Alex Parker
Following NASA’s approval of 2014 MU69 in August, we began planning a series of trajectory adjustments so that New Horizons can get there. Those engine burns will take place between October 22nd and November 4th. The result of that will be a roughly 1,150-day flight of about a billion miles, culminating with an intercept on January 1, 2019, at a point 44.2 a.u. from the Sun. The flyby speed will be 14.4 km (8.9 miles) per second.
This flyby is contingent on NASA approving and funding a 4-year extension to the New Horizons mission — a decision planned for late summer 2016 (about when the last of our Pluto data reaches Earth). If that approval comes, then along the way to 2014 MU69 the spacecraft will also make observations of the heliosphere using our SWAP and PEPSSI plasma instruments, our dust impact counter, and our ultraviolet spectrograph.
We’ll also be taking images of about 20 other KBOs that New Horizons will pass distantly. We won’t see them resolved, but the resulting images will allow us to study how light reflects off their surfaces at varying Sun-object-camera angles — the kind of photometric studies of their surface properties that can’t be made from Earth. We’ll also use the spacecraft’s camera to search more deeply for satellites around these KBOs than any Earth-based instrument or Hubble can do. These studies of small KBO surface properties and satellite populations will be a significant and completely unique contribution that only New Horizons can make.
Of course, the main science of the KBO mission, if funded, will be the flyby of 2014 MU69 itself. Our objectives for that flyby include:</p>

<p>mapping the surface geology to learn how it formed and has evolved
measuring the surface temperature
mapping the 3D surface topography
mapping the surface composition to learn how it is similar to and how it is different from comets like 67P and small planets like Pluto
searching for any signs of activity, such as a cloud-like coma
searching for (and studying any) satellites or rings
measuring or constraining its mass</p>

<p>Astronomers don’t yet know the exact shape of “PT1” (2014 MU69), but its estimated 45-km diameter is much larger than that of a typical comet. NASA / JHU-APL / SWRI
Our team is already determining how close we can come to 2014 MU69. We hope to approach much closer than we did to Pluto, so that the imaging and spectral observations collected will have higher resolution than we obtained at Pluto. We also intend to employ all seven of the instruments aboard New Horizons. If the extended mission is approved, we’ll build a much more detailed encounter observation plan in 2017 followed by development and testing the following year.
We expect New Horizons to begin making observations of 2014 MU69 in October 2018, beginning with satellite searches and navigation sightings to home in on the target. We won’t see it resolved as a disk (or whatever shape it has) until the spacecraft begins its intensive operations just a few days before the encounter.
So mark January 1, 2019, on your long-range calendar. Although this flyby probably won’t be as dramatic as the exploration of Pluto we just completed, it will be a record-setter for the most distant exploration of an object ever made. It will also be a KBO science bonanza — something we’ll share with you and the world — that’s unlikely to be repeated for decades.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the most fundamental level, we are all code. The typical human body is an assembly of some 37 trillion cells, and each holds all the information needed to make a complete human being.
Our DNA, the double-stranded helix responsible for heredity, contains 3 billion letters that dictate everything from hair and skin color to blood type. In fact, DNA is the most important identity document we will ever carry. Besides random mutations and damage, it doesn’t change from the day we’re born.
But that paradigm may soon start to shift. Scientists around the world have been experimenting with a powerful new tool called the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which has begun to open up the possibility of rewriting faulty or unwanted human, animal and plant DNA.
“We now have a way of easily making changes directly to the genome,” says Anja Smith, the research and development director at Dharmacon, a unit of GE Healthcare Life Sciences developing technologies for gene expression and editing, including CRISPR-Cas9. “You can now go directly into the cell itself and make changes to genes.”

A Revolution in the making
Genetic engineering has advanced rapidly since the 1970s, when scientists first combined snips of DNA from one bacterium or virus with another. The genetic blueprints for life are almost entirely written in a seemingly simple language whose alphabet has just four letters, which stand for four different molecules called nucleic acids: A for adenine, C for cytosine, G for guanine and T for thymine.
Sequences of these letters spell out what we call genes, the basic units for inherited traits like blue eyes or the blood disorder hemophilia.
The ability to start reading that code, called DNA sequencing, took off in the 1970s and began accelerating in the 1980s. By 2003, scientists from the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the private firm Celera Genomics announced they had sequenced the first essentially complete human genome.
If genetic engineering were a race, everything that preceded decoding the human genome was only a trip to the starting line.
After that, the tempo picked up quickly. There was the phenomenal discovery that allowed scientists to effectively stop genes from working, a process called RNA interference. This allowed researchers to start silencing targeted genes, turning them off to see what would happen and learn what they do. That led to a torrent of findings that started to reveal exactly which genes are associated with disorders ranging from cancers to neurodegenerative diseases. The technique won its discoverers, Andrew Fire and Craig Mello, a Nobel Prize in 2006.
Along the way, researchers also began refining the difficult technique of inserting foreign DNA sequences into host genomes, getting the host cell to follow the foreign instructions and produce entirely foreign proteins. The finding allowed biopharmaceutical companies to create bacteria that could mass-produce the hormone insulin outside the human body.
In 2012, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna revealed the CRISPR-CAS9 system, which allows researchers to go deeper and precisely edit and fix individual genes. Their groundbreaking work has triggered the next revolution in genetic engineering.

In the early 2000s, biologists realized that bacteria and their microscopic cousins, archaea, had short sequences of letters that showed up over and over again in their own DNA. These came to be known as “clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats,” or CRISPRs.
It turned out that the sequence of letters between these CRISPRs were actually parts of foreign DNA from viruses, which had previously attacked the bacterium. After defeating the virus, the bacterium incorporated a piece of the invading DNA into its own to recognize the next time it was under attack.
This bacterial acquired immunity defense system was a clever cut-and-paste job. The scissors were the bacterium’s DNA-cutting protein called Cas9. The pasted bit included DNA information identifying the virus.
Scientists figured they could use this same system to target specific parts of any DNA to cut and splice in new sequences at precise locations. They’ve also learned how to use the system to silence genes, activate silenced genes, and to add in sequences for whole new functions.
So far, CRISPR-Cas9 has proven to be extremely versatile, effectively targeting, cutting and editing DNA in human cancer and stem cells, yeast, fish, rabbits, wheat, and other organisms. “If you design an RNA sequence that’s 20 letters long that corresponds to the part of the DNA you want to edit, you can direct the CRISPR-Cas9 system to make a double-strand break anywhere in DNA,” Smith says. “It’s an easy way to knock out genes to help understand what they do, but it also allows an easy way to create insertions that are very precise and could be used to treat disease. This discovery has totally reinvigorated the potential of gene therapy, and somebody is going to win a Nobel Prize for it.”
&gt;DNA base pairs: Millions of pairs of just four nucleic acids– Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine and Thymine – form the DNA. Image credit: Getty Images
The gene-editing technology is still being developed and businesses like Dharmacon are helping speed up the research process. The GE unit has recently released a product called Edit-R – editor, get it? – which drops from weeks to days the time it takes to build the genetic sequence the system uses to guide the Cas9 cutting protein to the exact spot along the target DNA. “We’re removing the steps that are required to save researchers time,” Smith says. “Edit-R is also more amenable to higher-throughput testing, which can be used to screen hundreds or thousands of genes at a time for biomedical research.”
Smith says rapid and accurate editing of genes opens up all sorts of research opportunities, from creating disease mutations for study to routes for new therapies against cancers, immune diseases and other ailments.
This gene-editing tool isn’t just expected to be useful against human disease; researchers plan to use it for improving crops and livestock and potentially even for projects like mosquito control. Revolutionary though CRISPR-Cas9 may be, such a powerful instrument to delete, insert or edit genes also comes with big ethical questions that are still being argued.
In April, Chinese scientists announced they had used the system to genetically alter human embryos for the first time. The revelation set off vigorous debate in scientific circles and among the general public. Should such powerful scientific tools be used to alter the DNA of a human before they are even born? If so, should that engineering be limited to fixing genetic mistakes that will lead to serious or fatal disorder, or can it be also used to augment people to have preferred traits?
Such concerns are still a ways off, but the case of the Chinese research is just the first in what will surely be more difficult questions now that genetic engineering is starting to look more like programming computer code.
“People are being very cautious about this,” Smith says. “It’s warranted. This is very new technology and we aren’t necessarily sure what editing one part of the DNA will do in another part of the cell. You’re targeting gene X, but are you accidentally also targeting gene Y and Z? The answer to this is still unknown.”</p>

  <p>Thanks to the Rosetta spacecraft, researchers can follow the cycle of water escaping from the nucleus of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, as it appeared in September 2014. Scientists have intensively studied Hapi, the bright region in the boxed area, for evidence of water ice and escaping vapor.ESA / Rosetta team
The bizarrely shaped periodic comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko reached perihelion on August 13th, coming just 1.24 astronomical units (186 million km) from the Sun. All the while European Space Agency scientists have used the Rosetta spacecraft to provide a fascinating look at what happens on the surface of a comet during its most active phase — and to peek into what’s going on down below as well.
Since reaching Comet 67P in August 2014, Rosetta has documented the comet’s evolving activity and the outgassing of volatiles such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. But the source and cycling of its water has remained a major mystery. The comet’s nucleus has been releasing plenty of water vapor, yet very little ice lies exposed on its surface.
As the comet approached the Sun, key changes became evident on the surface, especially along Imhotep, a flat region at the larger end of the double-lobed nucleus. Large pits appeared in sequences shot using Rosetta’s OSIRIS narrow-angle camera in early June and July, apparently caused by collapse after underlying ice sublimated due to intense sunlight and escaped.
But these aren’t your run-of-the-mill Floridian sinkholes, as water vapor and other gases appear to be percolating up from the layers below.
Mission scientists spent months using Rosetta’s Visible Infrared and Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) to note how outgassing is driven by sunlight and the comet’s day-night cycle. Eventually they identified a surface region where water ice appears and disappears in sync with its 12.4-hour rotation period. “This keeps the comet ‘alive’,” explains Maria Cristina De Sanctis (INAF-IAPS) in an ESA press release. She is lead author of results published in September 24th’s Nature and presented this week at the European Planetary Science Congress.
By comparing these images and near-infrared maps of the Hapi region, Rosetta scientists have found that water ice is present on colder patches, while it is less abundant or absent on warmer patches. In addition, water ice was only detected on a patch of the surface when it was cast in shadow. ESA / Rosetta / M. C. De Sanctis &amp; others
De Sanctis and her colleagues believe that a layer of ice just below the porous surface sublimates and rises to the top and escapes during midday heat. At nightfall, the surface cools rapidly — but water vapor continues to rise from the still-warm layer below. It freezes onto the surface, creating a temporary veneer of ice that dissipates in the morning light. This sequence is shown schematically below.
To support this notion, the team used Rosetta to monitor a 1-km-square patch of the Hapi region, located along the “neck” connecting the two enormous lobes. Hapi was the first-noted source of escaping water vapor, seen by Rosetta while the comet was still 500 million kilometers (310 million miles) from the Sun (out beyond the orbit of Mars. The signature of water ice appeared in near-infrared spectra of the region, but only when it was in partial shadow. When seen in full sunlight, the ice was gone.
The daily water-ice cycle on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. A key discovery is that water vapor continues to leak from the interior at night, freezing onto the cold exterior. ESA / Rosetta / M. C. De Sanctis &amp; others
The team finds that water ice accounts for 10% to 15% of the material near the surface and appears to be well mixed with dust and other constituents. Moreover, the studied section of Hapi accounts for only 3% of all the water vapor escaping from the nucleus, so many such sources must be scattered over the nucleus.
“We’ve now been able to ‘clock’ the water activity of the comet versus its daily rotation better than ever before,” says Carey M. Lisse (Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory), who wasn’t part of the study. “We already knew from Deep Impact’s studies of 9P/Tempel 1 and 103P/Hartley 2 that cometary nuclei’s activity near the Sun vary on diurnal cycles, and this told us that the actively emitting regions must have been 1 to 5 cm down. The new Rosetta results tell us much more precisely where these actively emitting regions must lie.”
It’s fascinating to consider just what the alien world on the surface of a comet might look like and whether such outgassing would appear dramatic or subtle. Along with the dearth of water ice, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is a relatively dark object, with a surface albedo (reflectivity) near 6% — about that of fresh asphalt. This is darker than the Moon’s average albedo of 14%.
Advanced amateur astronomers and ground-based observatories have kept an eye on Comet 67P as well, as it approached 11th magnitude near perihelion.
Will Rosetta see the comet split in half? How typical is Comet 67P among short period comets? Future plans call for closer in surface operations for Rosetta, including a thorough hunt for the Philae lander and — just perhaps — bringing Rosetta in for a landing on the comet as well. Or ESA managers might opt to keep Rosetta about where it is now, hovering about 200 km above the nucleus. Doing that would avoid problems with close-in dust and allow the spacecraft to ride along with the comet for years — conceivably through an entire 6½-year-long orbit.

  <p> The total economic value of development costs of Linux Foundation Collaborative Projects estimated at $5 billion
SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., September 30, 2015 – The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization dedicated to accelerating the growth of Linux and collaborative development, today announced the immediate release of its first ever report that attempts to measure the estimated value of development costs in its Collaborative Projects. The report is titled “A $5 Billion Value: Estimating the Total Development Cost of Linux Foundation’s Collaborative Projects.”
Linux Foundation Collaborative Projects are independently funded software projects that harness the power of collaborative development to fuel innovation across industries and ecosystems. More than 500 companies and thousands of developers from around the world contribute to these open source software projects that are changing the world in which we live.
“Over the last few years every major technology category has been taken over by open source and so much opinion has been shared about the proliferation of open source projects, but not about the value,” said Amanda McPherson, vice president of developer programs and CMO at Linux Foundation, and co-author of the report. “As the model for building the world’s most important technologies have evolved from the past’s build vs. buy dichotomy, it is important to understand the economic value of this development model. We hope our new paper can help contribute to that understanding.”
The new report’s findings are based on David A. Wheeler’s proven COCOMO Model, which he pioneered in 2002 to inform what became a well-regarded study that assessed the value of a Linux distribution (The Linux Foundation performed a similar assessment in 2008). It assesses the Software Lines of Code (SLOC) in a project and the estimated person years and development costs associated to produce a value of the development costs (more detail is provided in the complete report).
The new report, “A $5 Billion Value: Estimating the Total Development Cost of Linux Foundation’s Collaborative Projects,” is the first attempt to estimate the cost of how much it would take to develop the technology and understand the value these projects collectively deliver to the industry.
Using Wheeler’s model, key findings in the report include:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The total lines of source code present today in Linux Foundation’s Collaborative Projects are 115,013,302.
The estimated, total amount of effort required to retrace the steps of collaborative development for these projects is 41,192.25 person years.  
In other words, it would take 1,356 developers 30 years to recreate the code bases present in Linux Foundation’s current Collaborative Projects listed above. The total economic value of this work is estimated to be over 5 billion dollars.</p>

<p>Current Linux Foundation Collaborative Projects include AllSeen Alliance, Automotive Grade Linux, Cloud Foundry Foundation, Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Code Aurora Forum, Core Infrastructure Initiative, Dronecode, IO Visor, IoTivity, Kinetic Open Storage Project, Let’s Encrypt, Node.js Foundation, Open Container Project, Open Mainframe Project, OPNFV, Open Virtualization Alliance, OpenDaylight, openMAMA, R Consortium, Tizen, Xen Project and Yocto Project. Not all projects were included in the analysis due to a variety just becoming LF Collaborative Projects. More details are available in the complete report.
“When people have the tools and connections to collaborate on a massive scale, any problem can be solved,” said Jim Zemlin, executive director at Linux Foundation. “We believe only the Distributed Genius of thousands of people working as one can solve the most challenging problems of our time. Collaboration is today’s competitive advantage.”
The report is co-authored by Jeff Licquia, software engineer at The Linux Foundation; and Amanda McPherson, The Linux Foundation’s chief marketing officer.

A planet's magnetic field emanates from its core and is thought to deflect the charged particles of the stellar wind, protecting the atmosphere from being lost to space. Magnetic fields, born from the cooling of a planet's interior, could also protect life on the surface from harmful radiation, as the Earth's magnetic field protects us.
Earth-like planets orbiting close to small stars probably have magnetic fields that protect them from stellar radiation and help maintain surface conditions that could be conducive to life, according to research from astronomers at the University of Washington.
Low-mass stars are among the most common in the universe. Planets orbiting near such stars are easier for astronomers to target for study because when they transit, or pass in front of, their host star, they block a larger fraction of the light than if they transited a more massive star. But because such a star is small and dim, its habitable zone -- where an orbiting planet gets the heat necessary to maintain life-friendly liquid water on the surface -- also lies relatively close in.
And a planet so close to its star is subject to the star's powerful gravitational pull, which could cause it to become tidally locked, with the same side forever facing its host star, as the moon is with the Earth. That same gravitational tug from the star also creates tidally generated heat inside the planet, or tidal heating. Tidal heating is responsible for driving the most volcanically active body in our solar system, Jupiter's moon Io.
In a paper published Sept. 22 in the journal Astrobiology, lead author Peter Driscoll sought to determine the fate of such worlds across time: "The question I wanted to ask is, around these small stars, where people are going to look for planets, are these planets going to be roasted by gravitational tides?" He was curious, too, about the effect of tidal heating on magnetic fields across long periods of time.
The research combined models of orbital interactions and heating by Rory Barnes, assistant professor of astronomy, with those of thermal evolution of planetary interiors done by Driscoll, who began this work as a UW postdoctoral fellow and is now a geophysicist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C.
Their simulations ranged from one stellar mass -- stars the size of our sun -- down to about one-tenth of that size. By merging their models, they were able, Barnes said, "to produce a more realistic picture of what is happening inside these planets."
Barnes said there has been a general feeling in the astronomical community that tidally locked planets are unlikely to have protective magnetic fields "and therefore are completely at the mercy of their star." This research suggests that assumption false.
Far from being harmful to a planet's magnetic field, tidal heating can actually help it along -- and in doing so also help the chance for habitability.
This is because of the somewhat counterintuitive fact that the more tidal heating a planetary mantle experiences, the better it is at dissipating its heat, thereby cooling the core, which in turn helps create the magnetic field.
Barnes said that in computer simulations they were able to generate magnetic fields for the lifetimes of these planets, in most cases. "I was excited to see that tidal heating can actually save a planet in the sense that it allows cooling of the core. That's the dominant way to form magnetic fields."
And since small or low mass stars are particularly active early in their lives -- for the first few billion years or so -- "magnetic fields can exist precisely when life needs them the most."
Driscoll and Barnes also found through orbital calculations that the tidal heating process is more extreme for planets in the habitable zone around very small stars, or those less than half the mass of the sun.
For planets in eccentric, or noncircular orbits around such low mass stars, they found that these orbits tend to become more circular during the time of extreme tidal heating. Once that circularization takes place, the planet stops experiencing any tidal heating at all.
The research was done through the Virtual Planetary Laboratory, a UW-based interdisciplinary research group funded through the NASA Astrobiology Institute.
"These preliminary results are promising, but we still don't know how they would change for a planet like Venus, where slow planetary cooling is already hindering magnetic field generation," Driscoll said. "In the future, exoplanetary magnetic fields could be observable, so we expect there to be a growing interest in this field going forward."
