  <p>Whole genome sequencing of modern and ancient horses unveils the genes that have been selected by humans in the process of domestication through the last 5,500 years, but also reveals the cost of this domestication. An international research group reports that a significant part of the genetic variation in modern domesticated horses could be attributed to interbreeding with the descendants of a now extinct population of wild horses. This population was distinct from the only surviving wild horse population.</p>

>(NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center) Each day, thunderstorms around the world produce about a thousand quick bursts of gamma rays, some of the highest-energy light naturally found on Earth. By merging records of events seen by NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope with data from ground-based radar and lightning detectors, scientists have completed the most detailed analysis to date of the types of thunderstorms involved.

  <p>A technique for ‘editing’ the genome in sperm-producing adult stem cells has been demonstrated by researchers, a result with powerful potential for basic research and for gene therapy. The study involved spermatogonial stem cells, which are the foundation for the production of sperm and are the only adult stem cells that contribute genetic information to the next generation. Repairing flaws in the cells could thus prevent mutations from being passed to future generations, researchers say.</p>

And what’s even more remarkable is the fact that the record was achieved by using commercially available solar cells in a new way – which means, as the team explains, “these efficiency improvements are readily accessible to the solar industry.”</p>

  <p>A NASA spacecraft has emerged from hibernation in preparation for completing its nine-year, 2.9-billion mile journey to observe Pluto from up close, the space agency said.
Sending its signal at the speed of light, the New Horizons ship beamed a report down to Earth that it was back in active mode as of Dec. 6.
“Technically, this was routine, since the wake-up was a procedure that we’d done many times before,” said Glen Fountain, the mission’s project manager. “Symbolically, however, this is a big deal. It means the start of our pre-encounter operations.”
After tests early next year, the spacecraft will collect data and images about Pluto and its surrounding moons. It will come closest to the dwarf planet on July 14.</p>

  <p><span style="color: #5274ae;">Scientists think they’ve figured out what causes the mysterious ruddy coloring in the giant planet’s enormous oval storm.&lt;div
id="attachment_255429997" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;<a href="http://www.damianpeach.com/jup1314/2014_02_25rgb0305.jpg"><img class="wp-image-255429997 size-large" src="http://d366w3m5tf0813.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Jupiter_2014_02_25_Peach-383x360.jpg" alt="Jupiter's appearance in February 2014" width="383" height="360" />&lt;p
class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Earlier this year, the Great Red Spot stood out prominently against Jupiter’s bright zones and dark belts.<br /> Damian PeachWhen it comes to well-known planetary features, Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is near the top of everyone’s list. It’s truly enormous — much bigger than Earth — though <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/observing-news/jupiters-great-red-spot/" target="_blank">its girth has shrunk over the past decade.The Great Red Spot is as mysterious as it is majestic. Unlike hurricanes and cyclones on Earth, which come and go in a matter of days, this iconic oval has endured for centuries. Giovanni Battista Riccioli and Gian Domenico Cassini noted it during the mid-1600s, though it could well have existed well before then.Astronomers have long pondered what causes the GRS to be so red — at least most of the time (the intensity of its hue changes, varying from a dark salmon to nearly white).One important clue comes from the spot’s overall structure and 5-day-long rotation. Unlike terrestrial hurricanes, which are low-pressure storms, the GRS is a high-pressure (anticyclonic) system that’s much taller than the clouds surrounding it. The spot’s cloudy interior is also relatively opaque, meaning whatever particles are coloring it must float near the top of this giant, buoyant bubble.&lt;div
id="attachment_255429999" style="width: 437px" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;<a href="http://d366w3m5tf0813.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Jupiter_infrared_Cassini.jpg"><img class="wp-image-255429999 size-large" src="http://d366w3m5tf0813.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Jupiter_infrared_Cassini-427x360.jpg" alt="Cassini's infrared view of Jupiter" width="427" height="360" />&lt;p
class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The Great Red Spot’s appearance at three infrared wavelengths, as recorded by NASA’s Galileo spacecraft in 1996, provides important clues to the big storm’s characteristics.<br /> NASA / JPL / K. BainesFor decades atmospheric chemists believed that <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/248788928_Photochemistry_of_phosphine_and_Jupiter%27s_Great_Red_SPOT" target="_blank">the spot was tinted with phosphine (PH3), an unusual compound found in the Jovian atmosphere. But more recently attention has focused on <a href="http://www.kuriositas.com/2011/12/dallol-worlds-weirdest-volcanic-crater.html" target="_blank">sulfur and its colorful allotropes. One of Jupiter’s three dense cloud layers consists of ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH), which, the thinking goes, could be dredged up by atmospheric convection and broken down by sunlight to form elemental sulfur.That’s what Kevin Baines, Robert Carlson, and Thomas Momary (all at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory) had in mind when they began laboratory experiments to try to replicate the coloring process. Carlson irradiated ammonium hydrosulfide with ultraviolet light, to mimic sunlight. But the resulting compounds were bright green, not red!So the researchers instead tried irradiating a mixture of ammonia (NH3) and acetylene (C2H2), both of which exist in Jupiter’s upper atmosphere. The result was a red concoction of cyanide-like molecules with the general formula HxCyNz where x, y, and z vary. Better still, the reddish particles have a spectrum that closely matches what NASA’s Cassini spacecraft recorded inside the Great Red Spot when it swept by Jupiter in late 2000 while en route to Saturn.Baines, Carlson, and Momary find that the best match involves particles just 400 nanometers across (the wavelength of blue light) thinly scattered in a layer only a few kilometers thick. The stuff looks red because it absorbs blue light strongly. “The model that fits is basically a ‘crème brûlée’ or ‘strawberry-frosted cake’ model,” Baines explains, with a narrow layer of reddish material on top of the main, whitish cloud layer. So beneath its reddish veneer, created at a pressure level of roughly 300 millibars, the Great Red Spot would actually look rather bland.&lt;div
id="attachment_255429998" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/jupiter/20141111/jupiter20141111-home.jpg"><img class="wp-image-255429998 size-full" src="http://d366w3m5tf0813.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Great_Red_Spot_PIA04866.jpg" alt="Cassini's view of Great Red Spot" width="480" height="274" />&lt;p
class="wp-caption-text"&gt;NASA’s Cassini spacecraft captured the complex circulation inside the Great Red Spot when it swept past Jupiter (en route to Saturn) on December 29, 2000.<br /> NASA / JPL / Space Science Inst.The spot’s rotation isolates and confines the atmospheric gases inside it, allowing these reddish colorants (impress your friends: they’re technically called chromophores) to accumulate. “The GRS acts as a cauldron,” Baines explains, “confining materials and letting them cook.”So why does the GRS’s color vary so much over time? Apparently its hue depends on how much of ammonia and acetylene are present, their exact altitude, and how long they’re exposed to sunlight. But the chemical conversion is rapid — Baines says they able to create the basic colors after just one day of “tanning” of the gas mixture in their lab tests.The three researchers presented their findings Friday at the annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society’s <a href="http://aas.org/meetings/dps46" target="_blank">Division for Planetary Sciences.

  <p>Vital personal and business information flows over the Internet more frequently than ever, and we don’t always know when it’s happening. It’s clear at this point that encrypting is something all of us should be doing. Then why don’t we use TLS (the successor to SSL) everywhere? Every browser in every device supports it. Every server in every data center supports it. Why don’t we just flip the switch?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The challenge is server certificates. The anchor for any TLS-protected communication is a public-key certificate which demonstrates that the server you’re actually talking to is the server you intended to talk to. For many server operators, getting even a basic server certificate is just too much of a hassle. The application process can be confusing. It usually costs money. It’s tricky to install correctly. It’s a pain to update.</p>

<p>Let’s Encrypt is a new free certificate authority, built on a foundation of cooperation and openness, that lets everyone be up and running with basic server certificates for their domains through a simple one-click process.</p>

<p>Mozilla Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., Akamai Technologies, Electronic Frontier Foundation, IdenTrust, Inc., and researchers at the University of Michigan are working through the Internet Security Research Group (“ISRG”), a California public benefit corporation, to deliver this much-needed infrastructure in Q2 2015. The ISRG welcomes other organizations dedicated to the same ideal of ubiquitous, open Internet security.</p>

<p>The key principles behind Let’s Encrypt are:</p>

<p>Free: Anyone who owns a domain can get a certificate validated for that domain at zero cost.
  Automatic: The entire enrollment process for certificates occurs painlessly during the server’s native installation or configuration process, while renewal occurs automatically in the background.
  Secure: Let’s Encrypt will serve as a platform for implementing modern security techniques and best practices.
  Transparent: All records of certificate issuance and revocation will be available to anyone who wishes to inspect them.
  Open: The automated issuance and renewal protocol will be an open standard and as much of the software as possible will be open source. 
  Cooperative: Much like the underlying Internet protocols themselves, Let’s Encrypt is a joint effort to benefit the entire community, beyond the control of any one organization.</p>

<p>If you want to help these organizations in making TLS Everywhere a reality, here’s how you can get involved:</p>

  <p>Are the fundamental constants really constant? Recent investigations carried out at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) have shown that one essential fundamental constant – namely the mass ratio of protons to electrons – can have changed only by a maximum of one part in a million over the age of our solar system (i.e. extrapolated over approx. 5 billion years). Previously, scientists deemed the possible changes to be twice as high. To obtain this result, physicists from PTB compared caesium and ytterbium atomic clocks with each other for 7 years. Their results, together with those of a similar experiment carried out at the British metrology institute NPL (National Physical Laboratory), have been published in the current issue of the journal Physical Review Letters.</p>

NASA's New Horizons spacecraft comes out of hibernation for the last time on Dec. 6. Between now and then, while the Pluto-bound probe enjoys three more weeks of electronic slumber, work on Earth is well under way to prepare the spacecraft for a six-month encounter with the dwarf planet that begins in January.
After several days of collecting navigation-tracking data, downloading and analyzing the cruise science and spacecraft housekeeping data stored on New Horizons' digital recorders, the mission team will begin activities that include conducting final tests on the spacecraft's science instruments and operating systems, and building and testing the computer-command sequences that will guide New Horizons through its flight to and reconnaissance of the Pluto system. Tops on the mission's science list are characterizing the global geology and topography of Pluto and its large moon Charon, mapping their surface compositions and temperatures, examining Pluto's atmospheric composition and structure, studying Pluto's smaller moons and searching for new moons and rings.
New Horizons' seven-instrument science payload, developed under direction of the Southwest Research Institute, includes advanced imaging infrared and ultraviolet spectrometers, a compact multicolor camera, a high-resolution telescopic camera, two powerful particle spectrometers, a space-dust detector (designed and built by students at the University of Colorado) and two radio-science experiments. The entire spacecraft, drawing electricity from a single radioisotope thermoelectric generator, operates on less power than a pair of 100-watt light bulbs.
"New Horizons is healthy and cruising quietly through deep space -- nearly three billion miles from home -- but its rest is nearly over," says Alice Bowman, New Horizons mission operations manager at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Md. "It's time for New Horizons to wake up, get to work, and start making history."
Since launching in January 2006, New Horizons has spent 1,873 days in hibernation -- about two-thirds of its flight time -- spread over 18 separate hibernation periods from mid-2007 to late 2014 that ranged from 36 days to 202 days long.
In hibernation mode much of the spacecraft is unpowered; the onboard flight computer monitors system health and broadcasts a weekly beacon-status tone back to Earth. On average, operators woke New Horizons just over twice each year to check out critical systems, calibrate instruments, gather science data, rehearse Pluto-encounter activities and perform course corrections when necessary.
New Horizons pioneered routine cruise-flight hibernation for NASA. Not only has hibernation reduced wear and tear on the spacecraft's electronics, it lowered operations costs and freed up NASA Deep Space Network tracking and communication resources for other missions.
Next month's wake-up call was preprogrammed into New Horizons' onboard computer in August, commanding it to come out of hibernation at 3 p.m. EST on Dec. 6. About 90 minutes later New Horizons will transmit word to Earth that it's in "active" mode; those signals, even traveling at light speed, will need 4 hours 25 minutes to reach home. Confirmation should reach the mission operations team at APL around 9:30 p.m. EST. At the time New Horizons will be more than 2.9 billion miles from Earth, and just 162 million miles -- less than twice the distance between Earth and the Sun -- from Pluto.
Distant observations of the Pluto system begin Jan. 15 and will continue until late July 2015; closest approach to Pluto is July 14.
"We've worked years to prepare for this moment," says Mark Holdridge, New Horizons encounter mission manager at APL. "New Horizons might have spent most of its cruise time across nearly three billion miles of space sleeping, but our team has done anything but, conducting a flawless flight past Jupiter just a year after launch, putting the spacecraft through annual workouts, plotting out each step of the Pluto flyby and even practicing the entire Pluto encounter on the spacecraft. We are ready to go."
"The final hibernation wake up Dec. 6 signifies the end of an historic cruise across the entirety of our planetary system," added New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute. "We are almost on Pluto's doorstep!"
New Horizons team members will give an overview of these preparations, as well as the science plans for the Pluto encounter, today at the American Astronomical Society Division for Planetary Sciences (DPS) meeting in Tucson, Arizona.

>(McGill University) Weather, which changes day-to-day due to constant fluctuations in the atmosphere, and climate, which varies over decades, are familiar. More recently, a third regime, called 'macroweather,' has been used to describe the relatively stable regime between weather and climate. A new study by researchers at McGill University and UCL finds that this same three-part pattern applies to atmospheric conditions on Mars.

>(University of California - Berkeley) UC Berkeley atmospheric scientist David Romps and his colleagues looked at predictions of precipitation and cloud buoyancy in 11 different climate models and concluded that their combined effect will generate 50 percent more electrical discharges to the ground by the end of the century because of global warming. The main cause is water vapor, which fuels explosive deep convection in the atmosphere. The more convection, the greater the charge separation and the more cloud-to-ground strikes.
