<blockquote>
  <p>There’s still a way to go from editing single-cell embryos to a full-term “designer baby.” But researchers at Oregon Health and Science University say they worked with single-cell embryos, inserting CRISPR chemicals at the time of fertilization.
 
The announcement by researchers in Portland, Oregon that they’ve successfully modified the genetic material of a human embryo took some people by surprise.
With headlines referring to “groundbreaking” research and “designer babies,” you might wonder what the scientists actually accomplished. This was a big step forward, but hardly unexpected. As this kind of work proceeds, it continues to raise questions about ethical issues and how we should we react.
What did researchers actually do?
For a number of years now we have had the ability to alter genetic material in a cell, using a technique called CRISPR.
The DNA that makes up our genome comprises long sequences of base pairs, each base indicated by one of four letters. These letters form a genetic alphabet, and the “words” or “sentences” created from a particular order of letters are the genes that determine our characteristics.
Sometimes words can be “misspelled” or sentences slightly garbled, resulting in a disease or disorder. Genetic engineering is designed to correct those mistakes. CRISPR is a tool that enables scientists to target a specific area of a gene, working like the search-and-replace function in Microsoft Word, to remove a section and insert the “correct” sequence.
In the last decade, CRISPR has been the primary tool for those seeking to modify genes – human and otherwise. Among other things, it has been used in experiments to make mosquitoes resistant to malaria, genetically modify plants to be resistant to disease, explore the possibility of engineered pets and livestock, and potentially treat some human diseases (including HIV, hemophilia and leukemia).
Up until recently, the focus in humans has been on changing the cells of a single individual, and not changing eggs, sperm and early embryos – what are called the “germline” cells that pass traits along to offspring. The theory is that focusing on non-germline cells would limit any unexpected long-term impact of genetic changes on descendants. At the same time, this limitation means that we would have to use the technique in every generation, which affects its potential therapeutic benefit.
Earlier this year, an international committee convened by the National Academy of Sciences issued a report that, while highlighting the concerns with human germline genetic engineering, laid out a series of safeguards and recommended oversight. The report was widely regarded as opening the door to embryo-editing research.
That is exactly what happened in Oregon. Although this is the first study reported in the United States, similar research has been conducted in China. This new study, however, apparently avoided previous errors we’ve seen with CRISPR – such as changes in other, untargeted parts of the genome, or the desired change not occurring in all cells. Both of these problems had made scientists wary of using CRISPR to make changes in embryos that might eventually be used in a human pregnancy. Evidence of more successful (and thus safer) CRISPR use may lead to additional studies involving human embryos.
What didn’t happen in Oregon?
First, this study did not entail the creation of “designer babies,” despite some news headlines. The research involved only early stage embryos, outside the womb, none of which was allowed to develop beyond a few days.
In fact, there are a number of existing limits – both policy-based and scientific – that will create barriers to implanting an edited embryo to achieve the birth of a child. There is a federal ban on funding gene editing research in embryos; in some states, there are also total bans on embryo research, regardless of how funded. In addition, the implantation of an edited human embryos would be regulated under the federal human research regulations, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Actand potentially the federal rules regarding clinical laboratory testing.
Beyond the regulatory barriers, we are a long way from having the scientific knowledge necessary to design our children. While the Oregon experiment focused on a single gene correction to inherited diseases, there are few human traits that are controlled by one gene. Anything that involves multiple genes or a gene/environment interaction will be less amenable to this type of engineering. Most characteristics we might be interested in designing – such as intelligence, personality, athletic or artistic or musical ability – are much more complex.
Second, while this is a significant step forward in the science regarding the use of the CRISPR technique, it is only one step. There is a long way to go between this and a cure for various disease and disorders. This is not to say that there aren’t concerns. But we have some time to consider the issues before the use of the technique becomes a mainstream medical practice.
So what should we be concerned about?
Taking into account the cautions above, we do need to decide when and how we should use this technique.
Should there be limits on the types of things you can edit in an embryo? If so, what should they entail? These questions also involve deciding who gets to set the limits and control access to the technology.
We may also be concerned about who gets to control the subsequent research using this technology. Should there be state or federal oversight? Keep in mind that we cannot control what happens in other countries. Even in this country it can be difficult to craft guidelines that restrict only the research someone finds objectionable, while allowing other important research to continue. Additionally, the use of assisted reproductive technologies (IVF, for example) is largely unregulated in the U.S., and the decision to put in place restrictions will certainly raise objections from both potential parents and IVF providers.
Moreover, there are important questions about cost and access. Right now most assisted reproductive technologies are available only to higher-income individuals. A handful of states mandate infertility treatment coverage, but it is very limited. How should we regulate access to embryo editing for serious diseases? We are in the midst of a widespread debateabout health care, access and cost. If it becomes established and safe, should this technique be part of a basic package of health care services when used to help create a child who does not suffer from a specific genetic problem? What about editing for nonhealth issues or less serious problems – are there fairness concerns if only people with sufficient wealth can access?
So far the promise of genetic engineering for disease eradication has not lived up to its hype. Nor have many other milestones, like the 1996 cloning of Dolly the sheep, resulted in the feared apocalypse. The announcement of the Oregon study is only the next step in a long line of research. Nonetheless, it is sure to bring many of the issues about embryos, stem cell research, genetic engineering and reproductive technologies back into the spotlight. Now is the time to figure out how we want to see this gene-editing path unfold.

  <p>The European Space Agency switched off its groundbreaking LISA Pathfinder mission this week.

A pioneering mission came to a quiet end earlier this week, as the European Space Agency’s LISA Pathfinder finished its mission. Controllers at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, sent the final commands to the spacecraft shortly after 20:00 Central European Time on Tuesday, July 18th.
“When we were in contact with LISA Pathfinder yesterday evening for the last time and said goodbye to the satellite, it was a unique and emotional moment,” says Karsten Danzmann (Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics, Germany) in a recent press release. “After years of planning, we have been spending many days and nights since early 2016 paving the way for the future of gravitational-wave astronomy with LISA Pathfinder.”
Launched on December 3, 2015, just before the announcement of the first direct detection of the ripples in spacetime known as gravitational waves, LISA Pathfinder was a technology demonstrator for the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. LISA will listen for low-frequency gravitational waves, such as those generated by merging supermassive black holes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LISA Pathfinder performed its mission from a lissajous, or halo, orbit around the L1 Lagrange point, 1.5 million kilometers sunward of Earth. This gravitationally quiet environment allowed LISA Pathfinder to keep two 44-millimeter-diameter, gold-platinum cubes in free fall for an extended period of time, separated from each other by a distance of 38 cm.
Designed not to detect gravitational waves but rather serve as a technology test bed, LISA Pathfinder met its key technology criterion in June 2016. In fact, ESA scientists announced then, LISA Pathfinder was actually five times more sensitive than required.

ESA also managed to get some extra science out of the mission. For example, LISA Pathfinder was used to sample the local micrometeoroid environment by detecting impacts on the spacecraft. Though the mission concluded on June 30, 2017, engineers continued to stress test the spacecraft, working out the thrusters and studying the effects of magnetic interference and solar illumination, known as “baking out” the instruments.

Though it was a non-imaging mission, the star-trackers did snap a few images of the Earth on the way to the L1 point as well.
The full-up LISA mission will have a long road to space. In 2011 NASA pulled out of its partnership with ESA due to budget constraints. The mission was later reborn under the ESA as ELISA (Evolved LISA). NASA is currently reviewing options to participate in the ELISA program. The mission has a planned launch date of 2034.
A New Era of Gravitational Wave Astronomy
The future LISA mission will feature three spacecraft flying in a triangular formation, each 2.5 million km apart from its partners, trailing 50 million km behind the Earth in a heliocentric orbit. In this formation, it will probe lower frequencies that inaccessible to its ground-based counterpart, LIGO.

In addition to listening for the mergers of supermassive black holes and learning more about their formation, LISA will also test the fundamental principles of gravity as we currently understand it. For now, though, LISA Pathfinder will continue to silently circle the Sun for hundreds if not thousands of years in its stable orbit, a small stepping stone in the new era of astronomy.

<blockquote>
  <p>On June 1, U.S. and European physicists published the latest results in their quest for gravitational waves — tiny ripples in spacetime, generated by energetic events like the collision and merger of distant black holes. Meanwhile, a new gravitational wave observatory is under construction in Japan. Sky &amp; Telescope Contributing Editor Govert Schilling visited the KAGRA detector in 2016.
In a huge cave deep within Mount Ikeno in Western Japan, construction workers are building the world’s next big laser interferometer. An initial version of KAGRA (Kamioka Gravitational-wave Detector) was completed and tested in March and April 2016. Now, new equipment is installed to create the ‘baseline’ version of the instrument. Additional mirrors, towering suspension systems, new lasers, cryogenic cooling units — it’s a huge operation, hopefully finished by late 2018.
The bus stop at the Mozumi post office.Govert Schilling
From Tokyo’s Ueno train station, it’s a relaxing two-hour drive with the luxurious Shinkansen ‘bullet train’ to Toyama on Japan’s west coast. From there, an early-morning bus takes me into the mountains. It’s a stunning 75-minute ride along steep overgrown mountain slopes, covered with wisps of fog. I’ve been told to leave the bus at the Mozumi post office bus stop. Mozumi is a very small mining village just across the border of Gifu prefecture. Mining activities in this region date back to the 8th century. The Kamioka zinc and lead mine — named after another town some 10 kilometers down the road — suspended its operations in 2001, but some miner families still live here.
Mozumi villageGovert Schilling
The KAGRA headquarters are located in a new building overlooking the village. Respecting Japanese tradition, I change my shoes for the slippers provided at the building’s entrance. Unfortunately, they’re all much too small for my large Dutch feet. Yoichi Aso of the Japanese Gravitational Wave Project Office shows me around the small control room, where a 10-minute morning briefing takes place. He then provides me with a hard hat and a fluorescent safety vest and we drive some five kilometers to the entrance of the mine, about a thousand meters below the summit, in the side of Mount Ikeno.
The Kamioka mine has turned into a versatile physics facility over the past few decades. 1991 saw the start of the excavation of the huge cave that is now home to Super-Kamiokande — one of the world’s largest neutrino detector experiments. Other underground physics experiments at the Kamioka Observatory are the Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Antineutrino Detector (KamLAND) and the Xenon Detector for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (XMASS), which is searching for dark matter.
The central area of KAGRA. Govert Schilling
Through yet another horizontal tunnel, Aso takes me to the central area of KAGRA, where upgrade activities are in full swing. It’s an impressive sight: a huge cavern, filled with gleaming vacuum tanks, portal cranes, scaffolding, forklifts, beam pipes with huge bolted flanges, and racks of electronics. Thanks to the weird contrast between the rough-hewn rock and the high-tech equipment it all looks like the secret underground laboratory of some mad scientist in a sci-fi movie — it’s surreal.
The disadvantages of building a gravitational-wave laboratory underground are also very apparent. The rocky walls have been treated with an anti-dust coating, but the cave can never be as clean as the central buildings of the two LIGO detectors in the USA (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) or the European Virgo detector. The most sensitive parts of the equipment are all placed underneath ‘clean booths’: large plastic overpressure tents into which filtered air is blown.
A much bigger problem is water. As any speleologist knows, caves are notoriously wet. The relative humidity in the KAGRA cavern is anywhere between 75 and 100 percent. The water emerges through the walls of the caves and the two 3-kilometer tunnels. It even wells up through the tunnel floors, thanks to groundwater pressure. It’s an incredible amount: some 500 tons of water per hour.
The view down one of the KAGRA tunnels. Govert Schilling
Aso takes me to the near end of one of the damp and dimly lit tunnels. The stainless steel beam pipes will probably not suffer too much, but water has accumulated into small puddles on the tunnel floor, and I can clearly make out a constant dripping sound. Parts of the ceiling have been covered with huge sheets of plastic. To facilitate draining, the tunnel floors are slanted by some two degrees. Because of the tilt, the KAGRA mirror surfaces must be slightly tilted, too — another technological challenge.
The walls and ceiling of the central cavern are plastic lined to prevent water damage. Govert Schilling
Most of the walls of the central cavern are also plastic lined. But here, too, water is the main enemy. The problem was particularly severe in the spring of 2015, when the cave was flooded in some places by up to 10 centimeters of water. Water was dripping from the ceiling of the cave onto the clean booths. The installation of the vacuum system had to be suspended for several months.
Back in Tokyo, at the Mitaka campus of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), Italian-born project director Raffaele Flaminio is well aware that the problem is not yet under control. But, he says, the same has happened in the Gran Sasso underground particle physics laboratory in the Italian Alps. ‘Just after construction, there was water everywhere. Now, it’s solved. We will find a solution, too.’
When KAGRA is operational, hopefully in late 2018 or early 2019, there will be four large laser interferometers working together. Observing data will be shared between the American, European, and Japanese groups for joint analysis. Running four detectors in concert further reduces the false alarm rate. Moreover, if the Einstein waves from a neutron star or black hole merger are detected by four independent instruments, pinpointing the event on the sky can be done with a relatively high precision. Follow-up observations by automated counterpart searches with ground-based optical telescopes are going to be much more efficient.
Just a few years further in the future, hopefully in 2022, there will be a fifth large interferometer, in India. Known as LIGO India, it could be described as an Asian ‘outpost’ of the LIGO project, using U.S.-built equipment. Eventually, it will be an almost exact copy of the current Advanced LIGO detectors, with 4-kilometer arms.
Albert Einstein once said: “Look deep into Nature, and then you will understand everything better.” The same is true for the new sense that gravitational-wave astronomy is providing us with. We’ve learned to surf the waves of spacetime. The journey is far from over — it’s only just beginning.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even climate activists increasingly recognise that the lofty rhetoric of the global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, concluded in Paris over a year ago, will not be matched by its promises’ actual impact on temperatures. This should make us think about smart, alternative solutions. But one such alternative, geoengineering, is a solution that many people refuse to entertain.
Geoengineering means deliberately manipulating the Earth’s climate. It seems like something from science fiction. But it makes sense to think of it as a prudent and affordable insurance policy.
Climate summit after climate summit has failed to affect global temperatures for a simple reason: solar and wind power are still too expensive and inefficient to replace our reliance on fossil fuels. The prevailing approach, embodied by the Paris Agreement, requires governments to try to force immature, uncompetitive green technologies on the world. That’s hugely expensive and inefficient.
Engineered reality
The Bill Gates-led Breakthrough Energy Ventures fund announced last year provided reason for hope. At the centre of any response to global warming, we need to focus on making renewable energy cheaper and more competitive through research and development. Once innovation drives the price of green energy below that of fossil fuels, everyone will switch. Much more research funding is needed, but such innovation will take time. That’s where geoengineering could play a role.
This year, for the first time, the US Government office that oversees federally funded climate studies is formally recommending geoengineering research. The move had the backing of Barack Obama’s former science advisor John Holdren, who said that geoengineering has “got to be looked at”.
Geoengineering promises to be exceptionally cheap, making it much more likely than expensive carbon cuts to be implemented
Last year, 11 climate scientists declared that the Paris Agreement had actually set back the fight against climate change, saying: “Our backs are against the wall and we must now start the process of preparing for geoengineering.” The crucial benefit of investigating geoengineering is that it offers the only way to reduce the global temperature quickly. Any standard fossil fuel reduction policy will take decades to implement, and a half-century to have any noticeable climate impact. Geoengineering can literally reduce temperatures in a matter of hours and days. That is why only geoengineering, not investments in renewables, can be an insurance policy.
Moreover, geoengineering promises to be exceptionally cheap, making it much more likely than expensive carbon cuts to be implemented. This also means that it is more likely to be deployed by a single country or even a rogue billionaire. Given this, it is essential that we seriously investigate its effects beforehand, to ensure that it works and doesn’t deliver unexpected, negative results.
To be clear, I am not advocating that we should start geoengineering today or even in this decade. But it merits serious research, especially in view of the limitations of the Paris Agreement.

So, what exactly should be studied? Many methods of atmospheric engineering have been proposed. The most talked-about process takes inspiration from nature. When Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991, about 15 million tons of sulphur dioxide was pumped into the stratosphere, reacting with water to form a hazy layer that spread around the globe. By scattering and absorbing incoming sunlight, the haze cooled the Earth’s surface for almost two years. We could mimic this effect through stratospheric aerosol insertion, essentially launching material like sulphur dioxide or soot into the stratosphere.
Perhaps the most cost-effective and least invasive approach is a process called marine cloud whitening, whereby seawater droplets are sprayed into marine clouds to make them slightly whiter and reflect more sunlight. This augments the naturally occurring process by which salt from the oceans provides the condensation particles for water vapour, creating and boosting the whiteness of clouds.
Spending just $9bn on 1,900 seawater spraying boats could prevent all of the global warming set to occur this century
Research for the Copenhagen Consensus, the think tank I direct, has shown that spending just $9bn on 1,900 seawater spraying boats could prevent all of the global warming set to occur this century. It would generate benefits – from preventing the entire temperature increase – worth about $20trn. That is the equivalent of doing about $2,000 worth of good with every dollar spent.
To put this in context, the Paris Agreement’s promises will cost more than $1trn annually, and will deliver carbon cuts worth much less – most likely every dollar spent will prevent climate damage worth a couple of cents.
People are understandably nervous about geoengineering. But many of the risks have been overstated. Marine cloud whitening, for example, amplifies a natural process and would not lead to permanent atmospheric changes – switching off the entire process would return the world to its previous state in a matter of days. It could be used only when needed.
The case for serious research into geoengineering is compelling. As a growing number of scientists are recognising, the planet needs more opportunities to address global warming. With a climate outcome as weak and costly as the one implied by the Paris Agreement, such opportunities cannot arrive too soon.

<blockquote>
  <p>A recent NASA study outlines possible dedicated missions to the “ice giant’ planets Uranus and Neptune.
The outer solar system’s “twin” planets looked very different when visited by Voyager 2 during the 1980s. Uranus, spinning on its side, had a nearly featureless disk. But Neptune displayed numerous bright and dark cloud patterns, including a hurricane-like featured dubbed the Great Dark Spot.
In 2003, NASA’s Galileo mission came to an end by plunging into the atmosphere of Jupiter. Later this year, Cassini will follow suit, ending a decade and a half exploring Saturn and its moons. What’s next for planetary exploration? Some researchers are pushing the next logical step: dedicated orbiters for either or both of the “ice giant” outer planets, Uranus and Neptune.
NASA recently released a study outlining just how such a mission (or missions) might unfold. The study is part of a lead up to the next Decadal Survey for 2022–32, a time when planetary scientists prioritize their wish list of future missions. The last Decadal Survey, published by the National Research Council’s Space Studies Board, covered opportunities from 2013 through 2022 and offered detailed development studies for the Mars 2020 rover and Europa Clipper missions, though a dedicated Uranus orbiter was in the running as a distant third possibility.
“This study was one of many that will be performed to support the upcoming Decadal Survey deliberations,” says Curt Niebur (NASA-HQ). “Once [the next Decadal Survey] is received by NASA, which should occur in 2022, NASA will begin considering which priorities it will pursue and how it will go about implementing them.”
To date, only one spacecraft has visited the two outermost planets during its “grand tour” of the outer solar system: Voyager 2, which flew past Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989. But those visits were fleeting, giving planetary scientists brief glimpses of these distant worlds and moons as Voyager 2 headed out of the solar system. An Ice Giant Orbiter would, like Cassini, hang out and explore Uranus or Neptune long term.
Road Trip to the Outer Solar System
But it’ll be a long haul, for sure. The problem with outer solar system exploration is, you want a spacecraft moving fast enough to reach its intended destination in a decade or so — but too much speed makes slowing down to enter orbit out of the question. New Horizons was a good case in point, as it took over 9 years to reach Pluto and Charon, whizzing by at 13.8 km per second, with only a hectic flyby period of exploration possible.
Instead, the mission to either Neptune or Uranus would launch in the 2030—31 time frame, taking 12 to 13 years to reach its target. The study calls for a 50-kg kilogram payload with three main instruments and an atmospheric probe similar to the one Galileo delivered to Jupiter. An “Ice Giant Orbiter” would utilize either traditional chemical propulsion on a slingshot trajectory, or perhaps a new solar-electric propulsion (SEP) system currently in development. Similar to the thrusters aboard NASA’s Dawn mission, SEP propulsion offers the ability to maintain low thrust over long periods to build up speed.

The study notes that an optimal window for a Uranus mission using a gravitational flyby assist of Jupiter exists in 2030 to 2034, while the same window for a Neptune mission runs from 2029 to 2030. Getting an orbiter to Uranus via an assist from Saturn could be carried out prior to 2028.

An Ice Giant Orbiter would be a $2 billion “Flagship mission, the top end of what NASA flies for planetary exploration. Other Flagship alumni included Cassini and the Mars rover Curiosity. Other classes of NASA missions include mid-range ($500 million to $1 billion) New Frontiers missions such as Juno and OSIRIS-Rex and less-than-$500-million Discovery missions such as Lunar Prospector or Mercury’s Messenger.
Scientists proposed a dedicated return to Uranus and Neptune early in the development of New Horizons. Such a “New Horizons 2” mission would’ve been a clone of the original, but it was later dropped from the program due to cost constraints.
Prime objectives for either mission would include a study of the planet’s atmosphere, interior, and ring system as well as a survey of major moons and a hunt for more. Neptune’s large, strange retrograde moon Triton is of particular interest, as researchers believe it’s a captured Kuiper Belt object (KBO). At a minimum, an Ice Giant Orbiter mission would carry a mass spectrometer, wide and narrow angle cameras, a magnetometer and dust sensors.

Uranus in particular would offer a challenging target, as the planet rotates tipped on one side. When Voyager 2 flew past Uranus in 1986, its southern hemisphere was in the middle of a 21-year-long summer and its northern latitudes lay hidden in shadow. A future spacecraft would arrive with the seasons reversed.
“The quick look we got from the Voyager 2 flybys of Uranus and Neptune taught us many things, but critical mysteries remain,” says Mark Hofstadter (NASA/JPL). Compared to rocky terrestrial worlds or gas giants, ice-laden planets seem to be in a class by themselves. “Another important thing about Uranus and Neptune is that they seem similar to most of the exoplanets we are discovering around other stars,” Hofstadter says. “To understand those distant planetary systems, we need to understand two examples that we can actually visit.”
Planetary missions can provide a wealth of science discoveries for decades to come. For example, Georgia Institute of Technology researchers recently announced the magnetosphere of Uranus behaves like a light switch — a discovery that utilized Voyager 2 data gathered more than three decades ago.

As with every outer solar system mission to Saturn and beyond, an Ice Giant Orbiter would be equipped with a plutonium-fueled Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG) for power far from the Sun. NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy announced in 2016 that the latter would restart the production of Pu-238 (a different isotope than the fissile Pu-239 used in nuclear weapons) for space exploration, and this exotic cache should be available in the 2020s for space exploration. NASA also elected to halt development of an Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) engine in 2013, which would’ve been four times as efficient as traditional RTGs. That tough decision was due to budget cuts, though the study anticipates enhanced eMMRTGs and a Heatshield for Extreme Entry and Environment Technology (HEEET) to be available for an ice-giant mission in the late 2020s.
This idea comes at an exciting time of crisis and opportunity for NASA and solar system exploration. On one hand, our eyes in the outer solar system are going dark, as Juno, Cassini, and Dawn all finish up their respective missions. NASA also seems to currently favor selecting smaller, low-cost missions such as Mars InSight, Lucy, and Psyche — perhaps in an effort to assure all of its “eggs aren’t in one basket,” as opposed large expensive missions that might look attractive to the financial axe.
And perhaps, long mission timelines extending out to the 2040s are a bit depressing to children of the Apollo era… weren’t we supposed to be vacationing on Mars by 2017?
Remarkably, interplanetary missions that could run through the midway point for this century are now under serious consideration.

  <p>Take 10 minutes with this article and become an eclipse expert for family and friends.
Sure, you know the basic idea: A solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between you and the Sun, hiding part or all of the Sun from view. It’s weird, it’s unearthly, and it scared the bejeezus out of our ancestors who didn’t know what was going on. The stories they made up to explain eclipses were hair-raising. The drive to actually understand eclipses — well enough to predict them! — was one of the drivers of ancient astronomy, and thus one of the drivers for the whole idea of science itself.
When the Moon casts its shadow onto Earth, people on the ground see the Moon eclipsing the Sun. The shadow’s umbra is the dark central part where the eclipse is total. In the penumbra the Moon covers only some of the Sun, for a partial eclipse. (Not to scale!) Earth: Shutterstock / Fluidworkshop; S&amp;T Illustration: Patricia Gillis-Coppola
One breakthrough was grasping the scene from another viewpoint: The Moon is a sunlit ball and casts a shadow, and we see an eclipse of the Sun when the Moon’s shadow sweeps over us, like in the diagram above.
But there’s more to it than that — and if you want a fuller picture of what’s going to occur on August 21st, read on.
Celestial Geometry
First off: The Moon orbits around Earth about once a month. This repeating journey brings the Moon close to our line of sight to the Sun at the time of  “new Moon.” At that time the sunlit side of the Moon faces directly away from us; the Moon shows us only its darkened night side. And we can’t see even that — because when the Moon is near our line of sight to the Sun, it’s hidden in the Sun’s dazzling glare in the bright blue daytime sky.
Usually the Moon misses the Sun in these monthly near-lineups (for reasons I’ll get to later). But about every six months on average, at least part of the new Moon crosses at least part of the Sun’s face as seen from somewhere on Earth. Hence a solar eclipse.
If the Moon crosses the Sun off center as seen from your location, you get only a partial solar eclipse, with the Moon’s silhouette making what looks like a dent in the Sun’s brilliant face. A deep partial eclipse, where the dent is big, turns the Sun into a dazzling crescent.
But the really good stuff happens if the Moon crosses the Sun nearly dead center as seen from your location. Then you may get a total solar eclipse, blacking out the Sun completely for anything from a few seconds up to 7½ minutes.
A total eclipse also has partial-eclipse phases before and afterward. The partial phases take their time; the whole event usually runs about 3 hours from beginning to end.
The stages of a solar eclipse, from partial to total to partial, begin and end when the edges of the Moon and Sun make contact with each other. This happens four times from start to finish. S&amp;T illustration: Leah Tiscione/Gregg Dinderman
What To Expect
A total eclipse is much more spectacular than a partial — not only because the sky and land get much darker, but especially because during totality we get a rare look at the Sun’s intricate, feathery corona: its outermost atmosphere, made mostly of free electrons and protons that are trapped in the Sun’s loopy, streaky magnetic field.
The partial phase of a solar eclipse can be seen from a large swath of the world. On August 21st that includes all of North America, Central America, and the northern part of South America.
Here’s how the Moon’s shadow looked as it crossed Earth during the total solar eclipse on March 9, 2016. The islands of Indonesia are at lower left.JMA/SSEC/University of Wisconsin at Madison
But totality is reserved for a much smaller area. The dark center of the Moon’s shadow, the part where the Sun is completely blocked (the shadow’s umbra) is never more than about 160 miles wide by the time it reaches Earth, usually less. On August 21st, the narrow shadow-patch of totality will sweep across the United States from the Pacific to the Atlantic. That’s the part for which so many people are preparing to travel.
Your Eyes Are Worth Keeping
As you’ve probably heard many times, staring at the Sun’s dazzling surface, even when only part of it is in view, can damage your eyes and leave a permanent blind spot in your vision. Never stare at the bright Sun, whether a partial eclipse is in progress or not.
Instead, during the partial phases you need to look through a safe solar filter. One example is the kind that’s made to go over the front of a telescope. For viewing just by eye, all of the inexpensive little “eclipse glasses” that we have tested do just fine.
Or you can watch an image of the Sun as projected onto a piece of paper — using either a pinhole, which gives a very small, dim, crude image, or a pair of binoculars or a telescope, which project a much bigger, brighter, and sharper image onto paper.
While the Sun is hidden during totality, no filter is needed!   
The Workings in 3D
So why don’t we get a solar eclipse at every new Moon, you might ask? How does the Moon usually sneak by unseen?
The answer is that the solar system is not perfectly flat. In particular, the orbits of the Moon and Earth do not lie in quite the same plane. If you drew Earth’s orbit around the Sun on a flat sheet of paper, the Moon’s orbit around Earth would be tilted 5° out of the paper, floating a little above and below it except where the planes intersect. Eclipses happen only when both the Sun and Moon are close to this intersection, along what’s called the line of nodes.
A 5° tilt might not seem like much. But it’s 10 times the ½° width of the Sun as we see it in the sky. So, when new Moon happens somewhere other than at the line of nodes, the Moon has plenty of room to pass north or south of the Sun without crossing it. That’s why solar eclipses are uncommon.
Eclipses of the Moon
Sky &amp; Telescope
What about lunar eclipses? I haven’t mentioned them yet. These happen whenever the Earth-Moon geometry is reversed: when the Moon passes through Earth’s shadow. This is such a different kind of event that solar and lunar eclipses hardly both deserve to have the same name “eclipse”!
Why not? With a lunar eclipse, instead of something hiding something else as seen by you, you’re just seeing the Moon get shaded. And, the Moon never goes completely dark. Think of covering the Sun in the sky with your hand, versus looking at your hand’s shadow on the ground. Two different things.
During a lunar eclipse, people on the entire side of the world facing the Moon all see the same thing happening to the Moon at once, just like friends around you can all see the shadow of your hand on the ground. But when you cover the Sun with your hand, the Sun disappears only for you, not for the people off to the side. That’s part of what makes a total solar eclipse rare and special.</p>

We’d like to thank our community for creating a wide range of clients for automating certificate issuance and management.</p>

<p>The total number of certificates we’ve issued is an interesting number, but it doesn’t reflect much about tangible progress towards our primary goal: a 100% HTTPS Web. To understand that progress we need to look at this graph:</p>

<p>When Let’s Encrypt’s service first became available, less than 40% of page loads on the Web used HTTPS. It took the Web 20 years to get to that point. In the 19 months since we launched, encrypted page loads have gone up by 18%, to nearly 58%. That’s an incredible rate of change for the Web. Contributing to this trend is what we’re most proud of.</p>

<p>If you’re as excited about the potential for a 100% HTTPS Web as we are, please consider getting involved, making a donation, or sponsoring Let’s Encrypt.</p>

<p>Here’s to the next 100,000,000 certificates, and a more secure and privacy-respecting Web for everyone!</p>

  <p>Localization plays a central role in the ability to customize an open source project to suit the needs of users around the world. Besides coding, language translation is one of the main ways people around the world contribute to and engage with open source projects.
There are tools specific to the language services industry (surprised to hear that’s a thing?) that enable a smooth localization process with a high level of quality. Categories that localization tools fall into include:</p>
