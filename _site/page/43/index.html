>Thousands of never-before-seen genetic variants in the human genome have been uncovered using a new genome sequencing technology. These discoveries close many human genome mapping gaps that have long resisted sequencing. The technique, called single-molecule, real-time DNA sequencing, may now make it possible for researchers to identify potential genetic mutations behind many conditions whose genetic causes have long eluded scientists....

Somehow all of this coded information needs to be read and transcribed into messages that can be used by cells. New research has revealed that the initial steps of the reading process are actually remarkably similar at both genes and regulatory elements. The main differences seem to occur after the initial step, in the length and stability of the messages....

>Tens of millions of people live with autism and thousands of doctors and scientists study it. But the condition remains shrouded in mystery. “Autism proves to be a sprawling, foggy and inconsistent field,” writes the author David Mitchell, whose son is autistic. “Causes are unknown, though many careers are fueled by educated guesses.” The term “autism” has been around for more than a century, though our understanding of the condition has changed substantially. Physicians today talk about autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a broad group of conditions that affect the brain. But they are still looking for tools to diagnose it, assess where people fall on the autism spectrum and treat them. “Right now, diagnosing ASD is almost entirely based on be...

"I am not a visionary, I'm an engineer," Torvalds says. "I'm perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and just staring at the clouds ... but I'm looking at the ground, and I want to fix the pothole that's right in front of me before I fall in."...

>"I want you to reimagine how life is organized on earth," says global strategist Parag Khanna. As our expanding cities grow ever more connected through transportation, energy and communications networks, we evolve from geography to what he calls "connectography." This emerging global network civilization holds the promise of reducing pollution and inequality -- and even overcoming geopolitical rivalries. In this talk, Khanna asks us to embrace a new maxim for the future: "Connectivity is destiny."...
