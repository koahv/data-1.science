>A team from the University of New South Wales, Australia, just set a new world record for solar energy efficiency by successfully converting 40.4% of available sunlight into electricity. And what&#8217;s even more remarkable is the fact that the record was achieved by using commercially available solar cells in a new way &#8211; which means, as the team explains, &#8220;these efficiency improvements are readily accessible to the solar industry.&#8221; Read the rest of Scientists smash solar cell efficiency record by converting 40.4% of sunlight to energy Permalink | Add to del.icio.us | digg Post tags: commercial solar, concentrated solar power, efficiency, efficiency record, photovoltaics, Solar Cell, solar panel, solar plant, Sol...

The report&#8217;s authors found that onshore wind costs around $133 per MW/h to produce, whereas gas and coal cost up to $208 and $295 per MW/h each. However, continuing a controversy that shadowed the Commission last year, extracts from the report have already been published that fail to include the external costs, which is where many of the subsidies to coal, gas and nuclear are made.
