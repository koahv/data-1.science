Quasars are the brightest objects in the Universe; their intense light is generated by gas as it falls towards a black hole. These mysterious objects emitting radio waves were first identified in 1963 by radio astronomers who called them quasi-stellar radio sources, or quasars. Galaxies can contain millions or billions of stars, but are still dim by comparison. Understanding whether the numerous small galaxies outshine the rare, bright quasars will provide insight into the way the universe built up today’s populations of stars and planets. It will also help scientists properly calibrate their measurements of dark energy, the agent thought to be accelerating the universe’s expansion and determining its far future.
In a study published today in The Astrophysical Journal Letters by UCL cosmologists Dr Andrew Pontzen and Dr Hiranya Peiris (both UCL Physics &amp; Astronomy), together with collaborators at Princeton and Barcelona Universities, shows how forthcoming astronomical surveys will reveal what lit up the cosmos, and answer the question: does ultraviolet light come from numerous but faint galaxies, or from a smaller number of quasars?”
The new method proposed by the team builds on a technique already used by astronomers in which quasars act as beacons to understand space. The intense light from quasars makes them easy to spot even at extreme distances, up to 95% of the way across the observable universe. The team think that studying how this light interacts with hydrogen gas on its journey to Earth will reveal the main sources of illumination in the universe, even if those sources are not themselves quasars.
Two types of hydrogen gas are found in the universe – a plain, neutral form and a second charged form which results from bombardment by UV light. These two forms can be distinguished by studying a particular wavelength of light called ‘Lyman-alpha’ which is only absorbed by the neutral type of hydrogen. Scientists can see where in the universe this ‘Lyman-alpha’ light has been absorbed to map the neutral hydrogen.
Since the quasars being studied are billions of light years away, they act as a time capsule: looking at the light shows us what the universe looked like in the distant past. The resulting map will reveal where neutral hydrogen was located billions of years ago as the universe was vigorously building its galaxies.
An even distribution of neutral hydrogen gas would suggest numerous galaxies as the source of most light, whereas a much less uniform pattern, showing a patchwork of charged and neutral hydrogen gas, would indicate that rare quasars were the primary origin of light.
Current samples of quasars aren’t quite big enough for a robust analysis of the differences between the two scenarios; however, a number of surveys currently being planned should help scientists find the answer.
Chief among these is the DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) survey which will include detailed measurements of about a million distant quasars. Although these measurements are designed to reveal how the expansion of the universe is accelerating due to dark energy, the new research shows that results from DESI will also determine whether the intervening gas is uniformly illuminated. In turn, the measurement of patchiness will reveal whether light in our universe is generated by ‘a few cities’ (quasars) or by ‘many small towns’ (galaxies).
“It’s amazing how little is known about the objects that bathed the universe in ultraviolet radiation while galaxies assembled into their present form,” said co-author Dr Hiranya Peiris. “This technique gives us a novel handle on the intergalactic environment during this critical time in the universe’s history.”

When the universe was less than one microsecond old and more than one trillion degrees, it transformed from a plasma of quarks and gluons into bound states of quarks - also known as protons and neutrons, the fundamental building blocks of ordinary matter that make up most of the visible universe.
Using a calculation originally proposed seven years ago to be performed on a petaflop computer, Lawrence Livermore researchers computed conditions that simulate the birth of the universe. The theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) governs the interactions of the strong nuclear force and predicts it should happen when such conditions occur.
In a paper appearing in the Aug. 18 edition of Physical Review Letters, Lawrence Livermore scientists Chris Schroeder, Ron Soltz and Pavlos Vranas calculated the properties of the QCD phase transition using LLNL’s Vulcan, a five-petaflop machine. This work was done within the LLNL-led HotQCD Collaboration, involving Los Alamos National Laboratory, Institute for Nuclear Theory, Columbia University, Central China Normal University, Brookhaven National Laboratory and Universität Bielefed in Germany.
 </p>

<p> 
This is the first time that this calculation has been performed in a way that preserves a certain fundamental symmetry of the QCD, in which the right and left-handed quarks (scientists call this chirality) can be interchanged without altering the equations. These important symmetries are easy to describe, but they are computationally very challenging to implement.
“But with the invention of petaflop computing, we were able to calculate the properties with a theory proposed years ago when petaflop-scale computers weren’t even around yet,” Soltz said.
The research has implications for our understanding of the evolution of the universe during the first microsecond after the Big Bang, when the universe expanded and cooled to a temperature below 10 trillion degrees.
Below this temperature, quarks and gluons are confined, existing only in hadronic bound states such as the familiar proton and neutron. Above this temperature, these bound states cease to exist and quarks and gluons instead form plasma, which is strongly coupled near the transition and coupled more and more weakly as the temperature increases.
“The result provides an important validation of our understanding of the strong interaction at high temperatures, and aids us in our interpretation of data collected at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.” Soltz said.
Soltz and Pavlos Vranas, along with former colleague Thomas Luu, wrote an essay predicting that if there were powerful enough computers, the QCD phase transition could be calculated. The essay was published in Computing in Science &amp; Engineering in 2007, “back when a petaflop really did seem like a lot of computing,” Soltz said. “With the invention of petaflop computers, the calculation took us several months to complete, but the 2007 estimate turned out to be pretty close.”
The extremely computationally intensive calculation was made possible through a Grand Challenge allocation of time on the Vulcan Blue Gene/Q Supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

  <p>(Phys.org) —The ubiquitous classical digital computer encodes data in bits (a portmanteau of binary and digits) in either a 0 or 1 state. On the other hand, while a quantum computer also uses 0/1 data representation, these qubits (from quantum and bits), qubit states 0 and 1 can be simultaneously in what is known as a superposition – and a quantum computer can also make use of entanglement. For these reasons, quantum computers can potentially solve problems whose complexity is too resource-intensive for classical computation. That being said, quantum computers are very difficult to construct. Recently, however, scientists at University of Wisconsin, Madison have fabricated a qubit in a silicon double-quantum dot in which the qubit basis states are the singlet state and the spin-zero triplet state of two electrons. (A double quantum dot links two quantum dots – semiconductor nanostructures that confine the motion of conduction band electrons, valence band holes, or excitons in all three spatial directions.) Moreover, the researchers have for the first time integrated a proximal micromagnet, allowing them to create a large local magnetic field difference between the two sides of the quantum dot - thereby greatly increasing their ability to manipulate the qubit without injecting noise that would induce superposition decoherence.</p>

  <p>Image of colliding galaxies. Via Kent E. Biggs</p>

<p>Is there any place in the Universe where there’s truly nothing? Consider the gaps between stars and galaxies? Or the gaps between atoms? What are the properties of nothing?
I want you to take a second and think about nothing. Close your eyes. Picture it in your mind. Focus. Fooooocus. On nothing….It’s pretty hard, isn’t it? Especially when I keep nattering at you. Instead, let’s just consider the vast spaces between stars and galaxies, or the gaps between atoms and other microscopic particles. When we talk about nothing in the vast reaches between of space, it’s not actually, technically nothing. Got that? It’s not nothing. There’s… something there.
Even in the gulfs of intergalactic space, there are hundreds or thousands of particles in every cubic meter. But even if you could rent MegaMaid from a Dark Helmet surplus store, and vacuum up those particles, there would still be wavelengths of radiation, stretching across vast distances of space.
There’s the inevitable reach of gravity stretching across the entire Universe. There’s the weak magnetic field from a distant quasar. It’s infinitesimally weak, but it’s not nothing. It’s still something. Philosophers, and some physicists, argue that <em>that</em> nothing isn’t the same as “real” nothing. Different physicists see different things as nothing, from nothing is classical vacuum, to the idea of nothing as undifferentiated potential.
Even if you could remove all the particles, shield against all electric and magnetic fields, your box would still contain gravity, because gravity can never be shielded or cancelled out. Gravity doesn’t go away, and it’s always attractive, so you can’t do anything to block it. In Newton’s physics that’s because it is a force, but in general relativity space and time <em>are</em> gravity.
So, imagine if you could remove all particles, energy, gravity… everything from a system. You’d be left with a true vacuum. Even at its lowest energy level, there are fluctuations in the quantum vacuum of the Universe. There are quantum particles popping into and out of existence throughout the Universe. There’s nothing, then pop, something, and then the particles collide and you’re left with nothing again. And so, even if you could remove everything from the Universe, you’d still be left with these quantum fluctuations embedded in spacetime.
There are physicists like Lawrence Krauss that argue the “universe from nothing”, really meaning “the universe from a potentiality”. Which comes down to if you add all the mass and energy in the universe, all the gravitational curvature, everything… it looks like it all sums up to zero. So it is possible that the universe really did come from nothing. And if that’s the case, then “nothing” is everything we see around us, and “everything” is nothing.
What do you think? How do you wrap your head around the idea of nothing?</p>

Superlatives are the trademark of the planet Jupiter. The magnetic field at the top edge of the cloud surrounding the largest member of the solar system is around ten times stronger than Earth’s, and is by far the largest magnetosphere around a planet in our Solar System. Just why this field has a similar structure to that of our own planet although the interiors of the two celestial objects have a completely different structure, has mystified researchers for a long time.
With the aid of the most detailed computer simulations to date, a team headed by the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Göttingen has now succeeded in explaining the origin of the magnetic field deep inside the gaseous giant.
Jupiter autopsy: The magnetic field lines illustrate the high complexity of the magnetic field inside the planet, which, however, quickly decreases beyond the metallic layer (black line). On the surface, a dipolar part that is inclined by ten degrees with respect to the axis of rotation dominates. The thickness of the field lines is a measure of the local magnetic field strength. In the equatorial region, a jet produces bundles of field lines with a pronounced east-west orientation at the transition to the metallic layer. The colored contours represent the radial surface field. Red indicates field lines directed outwards, blue inwards; green denotes a weak field. The colour coding of the sections represents the field in the east-west direction &amp;ndash; red indicates eastwards, blue westwards.
 </p>

<p> 
Magnetic fields are always generated when electric currents flow. The Earth is surrounded by a magnetic field because, deep in its interior, there is a circulating molten mass of iron and nickel. This motion gives rise to electric currents that generate Earth’s familiar dipolar magnetic field, in much the same way as a bicycle dynamo operates. Physicists call it the geo-dynamo. But how does the dynamo inside of Jupiter work?
Jupiter consists predominantly of hydrogen and helium. Photos of the planet show coloured bands of cloud and gigantic tornados such as the Great Red Spot. The temperature at the upper cloud boundary is minus 100 degrees Celsius, but temperature, pressure and electrical conductivity increase enormously with increasing depth.
At a depth of just under 10,000 kilometres and a pressure of several million atmospheres, the hydrogen even becomes conductive like a metal – an exotic state of matter which does not exist on Earth. It is still unclear whether there is a rocky core at the centre of the planet; it could possibly amount to around 20 percent of the Jupiter radius – corresponding to 14,000 kilometres.
Previous computer simulations on the formation of the magnetic field had to greatly simplify this complex structure. The upper gaseous region and the lower metallic region were treated separately, for example. Thus, no computation correctly reproduced the strength and the form of the magnetic field as determined by space probes.
“Several colleagues assumed that certain physical quantities changed suddenly at the transition to the region of the metal-like conducting hydrogen,” says project leader Johannes Wicht from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Göttingen. But new models from colleagues at the University of Rostock seem to prove that this is probably not the case. The properties change gradually over the whole gas layer so that the separate treatment of the outer and inner region is hardly justified.
The important step forward here was the fact that, for the first time, the Göttingen-based physicists dealt with all regions of the planet in the same simulation. To this effect, the Max Planck Society’s huge Hydra supercomputer in Garching had to spend around six months on the computation.
The result was impressive: it portrayed Jupiter’s magnetic field more or less as space probes had determined it in nature. “The main part of the magnetic field, which looks so similar to Earth’s magnetic field, is generated deep inside the planet, where the properties no longer change so strongly,” says Wicht.
The new simulations indicate that a second, weaker dynamo is also active, however. It operates in the transition zone to the metallic layer near the equator. It is brought about by a strong wind blowing towards the east, a so-called jet, which can be recognised from the cloud movements. In the outer, cool regions of the atmosphere it is not yet possible for a magnetic field to be generated, as the conductivity here is too low.
But at greater depths the temperature rises, and from around 8,000 kilometres below the cloud cover, the electrical conductivity, thanks to the formation of plasma, is high enough for the dynamo to start.
“Crucial here is the product of wind speed and electrical conductivity,” explains Moritz Heimpel from the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. As soon as it exceeds a specific value, a magnetic field can form. “The jet shears the magnetic field in the east-west direction and produces a characteristic magnetic band structure in the equatorial region,” says Thomas Gastine, a staff member at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research.
“In order to portray the special properties of the two dynamo processes involved, it was particularly important to model the interior properties of the planet as accurately as possible,” adds Lucia Duarte, who carried out the first computation during her doctoral work at the Max Planck Institute in Göttingen.
Hence, two magnetic fields form, which superimpose: the Earth-like one in the deep layer of the metal-like conducting hydrogen, and the weaker band structure generated by the equatorial jet. “The Earth-like field corresponds in strength and structure to the measurement data to date provided by space probes, which do not allow the band structure to be resolved,” says Thomas Gastine.
The simulations span a period of around 6,500 years and also reveal changes. The field strength should vary, for example, and the inclination of the axis should change by around 0.02 degrees per year. It will soon be possible for the Juno space probe to check this and further properties predicted by the new model.
The American space craft was launched three years ago and is due to enter into an orbit around the giant planet in August 2016. “With the new measurement data, we will find out much more about the inner structure and the magnetic field than has been possible to date, and can hopefully confirm the band structures as well,” says Johannes Wicht.

The first breakthrough paper to come out of a massive U.S. expedition to one of Earth’s final frontiers shows that there’s life and an active ecosystem one-half mile below the surface of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, specifically in a lake that hasn’t seen sunlight or felt a breath of wind for millions of years. “We are looking at a water column that probably has about 4,000 things we call species. It’s incredibly diverse,” said Brent Christner, associate professor of biological sciences at Louisiana State University.
The life is in the form of microorganisms that live beneath the enormous Antarctic ice sheet and convert ammonium and methane into the energy required for growth. Many of the microbes are single-celled organisms known as Archaea, said Montana State University professor John Priscu, the chief scientist of the U.S. project called WISSARD that sampled the sub-ice environment. He is also co-author of the Mpaper in the Aug. 21 issue of Nature.
“We were able to prove unequivocally to the world that Antarctica is not a dead continent,” Priscu said, adding that data in the Nature paper is the first direct evidence that life is present in the subglacial environment beneath the Antarctic ice sheet.
Lead author Christner said, “It’s the first definitive evidence that there’s not only life, but active ecosystems underneath the Antarctic ice sheet, something that we have been guessing about for decades. With this paper, we pound the table and say, ‘Yes, we were right.’”
 
                      
 
Priscu said he wasn’t entirely surprised that the team found life after drilling through half a mile of ice to reach Subglacial Lake Whillans in January 2013. An internationally renowned polar biologist, Priscu researches both the South and North Poles. This fall will be his 30th field season in Antarctica, and he has long predicted the discovery.
More than a decade ago, he published two manuscripts in the journal Science describing for the first time that microbial life can thrive in and under Antarctic ice. Five years ago, he published a manuscript where he predicted that the Antarctic subglacial environment would be the planet’s largest wetland, one not dominated by the red-winged blackbirds and cattails of typical wetland regions in North America, but by microorganisms that mine minerals in rocks at subzero temperatures to obtain the energy that fuels their growth.

<p>Following more than a decade of traveling the world presenting lectures describing what may lie beneath Antarctic ice, Priscu was instrumental in convincing U.S. national funding agencies that this research would transform the way we view the fifth largest continent on the planet.
Although he was not really surprised about the discovery, Priscu said he was excited by some of the details of the Antarctic find, particularly how the microbes function without sunlight at subzero temperatures and the fact that evidence from DNA sequencing revealed that the dominant organisms are archaea. Archaea is one of three domains of life, with the others being Bacteria and Eukaryote.
Many of the subglacial archaea use the energy in the chemical bonds of ammonium to fix carbon dioxide and drive other metabolic processes. Another group of microorganisms uses the energy and carbon in methane to make a living. According to Priscu, the source of the ammonium and methane is most likely from the breakdown of organic matter that was deposited in the area hundreds of thousands of years ago when Antarctica was warmer and the sea inundated West Antarctica. He also noted that, as Antarctica continues to warm, vast amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, will be liberated into the atmosphere enhancing climate warming.

<p> 
The U.S. team also proved that the microorganisms originated in Lake Whillans and weren’t introduced by contaminated equipment, Priscu said. Skeptics of his previous studies of Antarctic ice have suggested that his group didn’t actually discover microorganisms, but recovered microbes they brought in themselves.
“We went to great extremes to ensure that we did not contaminate one of the most pristine environments on our planet while at the same time ensuring that our samples were of the highest integrity,” Priscu said.
Extensive tests were conducted two years ago on WISSARD’s borehole decontamination system to ensure that it worked, and Priscu led a publication in an international journal presenting results of these tests. This decontamination system was mated to a one-of-a-kind hot water drill that was used to melt a borehole through the ice sheet, which provided a conduit to the subglacial environment for sampling.
Every day in Antarctica, he would tell his team to keep it simple, Priscu said. To prove that an ecosystem existed below the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, he wanted at least three lines of evidence. They had to see microorganisms under the microscope that came from Lake Whillans and not contaminated equipment. They then had to show that the microorganisms were alive and growing. They had to be identifiable by their DNA.
When the team found those things, he knew they had succeeded, Priscu said.
The Whillans Ice Stream Subglacial Access Research Drilling (WISSARD) project officially began in 2009 with a $10 million grant from the National Science Foundation. Now involving 13 principal investigators at eight U.S. institutions, the researchers drilled down to Subglacial Lake Whillans in January 2013. The microorganisms they discovered are still being analyzed at MSU and other collaborating institutions.
Planning to drill again this austral summer in a new Antarctic location, Priscu said WISSARD was the first large-scale multidisciplinary effort to directly examine the biology of an Antarctic subglacial environment. The Antarctic Ice Sheet covers an area 1 ½ times the size of the United States and contains 70 percent of Earth’s freshwater, and any significant melting can drastically increase sea level. Lake Whillans, one of more than 200 known lakes beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet and the primary lake in the WISSARD study, fills and drains about every three years. The river that drains Lake Whillans flows under the Ross Ice Shelf, which is the size of France, and feeds the Southern Ocean, where it can provide nutrients for life and influence water circulation patterns.
The opportunity to explore the world under the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is an unparalleled opportunity for the U.S. team, as well as for several MSU-affiliated researchers who are part of that team and wrote or co-authored the Nature paper, Priscu said.
The fact that MSU was so involved reflects the fact that it is pioneering a new field of science, Priscu said. MSU is the common ancestor of many scientists who study life in and under ice.
“I always tell my students when they come into the lab that ‘We are inventing this field of science. It’s working on life in ice and under ice. This field has never existed before. We thought it up. You are pioneers,’” Priscu said.
Appreciative of the opportunity to participate in WISSARD, Vick-Majors said she saw bacteria under the microscope within an hour after the first sample of water was pulled out of Subglacial Lake Whillans. Within days, she saw proof that the bacteria were active.
“It was very exciting. It will be hard to top,” she said.
She added that, “If you want to do microbial ecology in Antarctic subglacial environments, John is probably the person you want to work with. I feel very lucky to have gotten the opportunity.”
Agreeing, Michaud said, “Some of the graduate students joke, ‘How do we top this?’ We can’t.”
But the students can build on their WISSARD experience and gain a deeper understanding of Subglacial Lake Whillans and other subglacial habitats, he said. It’s not about going out and finding more novel habitats.
Christner said the team that wrote the paper in Nature is the dream team of polar biology. Besides the MSU-affiliated scientists, the co-authors include Amanda Achberger, a graduate student at Louisiana State University; Carlo Barbante, a geochemist at the University of Venice in Italy; Sasha Carter, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California in San Diego; and Knut Christianson a postdoctoral researcher from St. Olaf College in Minnesota and New York University.

<blockquote>
  <p>Follow @LinuxUserMag
So computing is clouding over, but you have half a lifetime’s ‘stuff’ randomly saved across hard drives and thumb drives. Family photos; downloaded eBooks; text files helpfully named ’Notes’ and ’Misc’; PDFs of instruction manuals, brochures and cartoons; HOWTOs in HTML form; music and video files; lots of old source code; and even files you don’t even know how to open.
Spring has come and gone and still your disordered archive sits quietly but accusingly. It’s time to do something about it – but drag- and-drop sorting through everything will take ages. Instead, let’s brush up on some command line shortcuts and combine a tidying exercise with a learning opportunity.
Why do this from the command line? There are times when drag-and-drop is a convenient way to move files around but – for most operations involving several files in multiple directories – the command line can be a lot quicker. Not only that, but repetitive operations can be automated with scripts and scheduled jobs, as we’ll see later.
Read on and learn how to find files, automatically zip them up, collect them in backup partitions and send them securely to a remote server at scheduled intervals.
Step-by-step
Step 01 Big list
There are many ways to see how big a file is. Right-click&gt;Properties in a GUI file manager or ls -l filename, but ls -lhS (h to give human readable units) gives you a good look at the whole directory, ordered by file size.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Step 02 Du it
But if you’re just looking for disk use – not every file attribute – the disk use program, du, will be your best friend. Best of all, it searches recursively within directories.
Step 03 Pipe up
One of the great powers of *nix shells is piping commands together with the | pipe. This takes the output of one program and feeds it as the input to the command after the |.
Step 04 Sort it out
For example, feeding output to sort – in particular sort -n -r, which puts a list in numerical order (-n), from largest to smallest. -h tells sort to take into account KiB, MiB, etc, rather than -n’s ignorance of units.</p>

<p>Step 05 In depth
du’s recursive nature, while handy for discovering what’s filling your subdirectories, is a pain when you’re looking for a less detailed overview. Setting depth to 1 is some help…</p>

<p>Step 06 In the loop
While this combination is in part a workaround for non-GNU versions of sorts, on some versions of *nix, it also has the bonus advantage of showing large individual files and introduces loops in the shell.</p>

<p>Step 07 Helpful find
A better look, if you’re concerned with files, not directories, may be achieved through properties of the helpful find command. Here we’re using -type f to limit the search to files, and -printf %k %p to show size (in KiB) and filename.</p>

<p>Step 08 Space hogs
Having identified the type of files that are taking up the most space, in order to hunt them across your disk drive you will need to use the case-insensitive -iname switch and apply find to the root directory.
Step 09 Take your time
Searching across the whole filesystem takes real time – eight minutes here – and throws up the odd /proc irrelevance, but it is thorough and may surprise you with disk hogs you’d forgotten about, like old mailboxes.</p>

<p>Step 10 Music and movement
We’re going to use find to locate all of the MP3 files on the system – or at least those within the home directory – and move them to another disk. But before we do this we need to know what not to move…</p>

<p>Step 11 Exclusions
You may have games, or perhaps system sounds, in MP3 format, so – having searched the find results to double-check on them all – tell find to ignore the directories where they can be found.</p>

<p>Step 12 Snapshot</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>						GA_googleFillSlot("LUD_MidPage_MPU1");
					
				You’re going to be moving, not copying – this is a space-saving exercise – so take a snapshot of where the files are before you make any changes. That way you’ll know where to put things back, if necessary!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Step 13 Executive step
Calling -exec allows a command – in this case /bin/mv, the move command – to execute on each of the outputs of find. This is the safest option, as it takes care of special characters, and works on most *nix variants.</p>

<p>Step 14 Xargs
xargs is faster – running over the entire output of find at once – but needs print0 (not on all *nix) to safely operate special characters. Note these last two commands are each on just one line, don’t hit Enter till the end.</p>

<p>Step 15 Scripted move
If the object of your spring clean is just to tidy similar files into one directory, the job is done – but not quite. The time to create backups is always right now, since you don’t know when your disk will fail, or if your laptop will be lost or stolen.
A short script will take those files you’ve collected together, zip them up into a tarball, compress it and put it on another mounted directory. You might rather move your backup to a remote file server, for example. We’ll examine the options over the next few steps.</p>

<p>Step 16 Arm box
Backups need somewhere convenient to go. If you don’t already have a media box or other file server, but want to set something up, we recommend using something that’s quiet, unobtrusive and has low-power consumption: an ARM device – whether an old NSLU-2, a firmware-modified router or the good old Pi – would all be good options here.
Step 17 More Pi please
The real decision is software. Keep it simple: Debian. Forget NFS, SAMBA, or other remote file system mounts…
Step 18 Secure backup server
… just install the OpenSSH daemon. Now you can use SCP – secure copy – to backup your files in your scripts. Here we’re using an old Ubuntu netbook to upcycle as a media and print server – and a programmable photo frame!</p>

<p>Step 19 Key or pwd?
Your SSH server has a public key, but adding one from your local machine (to match its private key) would enable you to automate logins without having to leave the SSH password in plain text in your scripts.
Step 20 Obscure your port
While we’ll leave SSH keys as an exercise for you (though we may return to it in a future issue), we do suggest opening /etc/ssh/sshd_ config on your backup server and changing the value of Port to a random high number.</p>

<p>Step 21 Secure copy
If you didn’t set up keys, then install Sshpass – it’s the best way to send a password to SCP in a script – and add the line above into your script. It’s all on one line.</p>

<p>Step 22 Keeping regular
Now you have a script, you can call it through cron to run regularly with crontab -e. For example, if you generate and/or download many PDFs in a working day, or have particular folders to save, put those in the script.</p>

<p>Step 23 Command line GUI
Before we go, having shown you the power of the command line, we’re not saying GUIs don’t have a place. Install MC and you’ll get all of the power of keyboard-driven commands in a two-pane terminal-based filemanager.</p>

<p>Step 24 More scripts
In a future issue we’ll go further with shell scripting: the chaining together of programs and built-in commands in short scripts to remove the repetition of running through the same operations time and again. Happy days!

  <p>July was a banner month in Spain in terms of renewable energy production with 34 percent of the country’s energy needs being met by wind and solar energy. Wind was the prominent low-carbon energy source in the Iberian Peninsula, providing 30 percent of the country’s energy needs, while solar power supplied about 4 percent. July’s renewable energy output is particularly noteworthy considering that the total combined energy provided by wind and solar in the entire first six months of 2014 only reached approximately 25.3 percent.</p>

  <p>Scientists have created an artificial, network-like cell system that is capable of reproducing the dynamic behavior of protein synthesis. This achievement is not only likely to help gain a deeper understanding of basic biological processes, but it may, in the future, pave the way toward controlling the synthesis of both naturally-occurring and synthetic proteins for a host of uses.</p>
