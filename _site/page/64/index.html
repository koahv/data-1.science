>Talk about heavy metal! This shiny, lumpy rock spotted by NASA's Curiosity rover is likely made mostly of iron—and came from outer space! It's an iron meteorite, similar to ones found in years past by Curiosity's forerunners Spirit and Opportunity, but is considerably larger than any of the ones the MER rovers came across… in fact, at 2 meters (6.5 feet) wide this may very well be the biggest meteorite ever discovered on Mars!...

As scientists discover and classify new planets, one cannot help but wonder, what are these distant worlds really like? As it turns out, even the most imaginative book or film does little justice to real exoplanets; From planets with diamond cores, to worlds that hang between extremes, the beauty and diversity of exoplanets is both humbling and remarkable.

>There is a tiny spacecraft racing towards the most distant reaches of the solar system. It as known as New Horizons, and it started its journey nearly a decade ago. Launching in January of 2006, New Horizons has been making its way across our corner of the universe for the last 9 and a half years. It has been slowly approaching Pluto as time wanders on; however, when it finally reaches this tiny dwarf planet, the spacecraft will be anything but slow. It will pass Pluto and its moons (Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx) travelling at an amazing 26,7000 miles an hour (43,000 km/h). It will then continue its path into the Kuiper belt, a disc-shaped region of volatile icy compounds (like methane, ammonia, and water)—the home of the comets....

One day, in the far, far future, Earth will cease to exist, but its demise won&#8217;t happen all at once. In fact, it&#8217;ll happen oppositely, slowly and dramatically.

"Our experiments suggest that once the Earth formed, many of the building blocks of life were likely present from the beginning. Since we are simulating universal astrophysical conditions, the same is likely wherever planets are formed." NASA scientists studying the origin of life have reproduced uracil, cytosine, and thymine, three key components of our hereditary material, in the laboratory. They discovered that an ice sample containing pyrimidine exposed to ultraviolet radiation under space-like conditions produces these essential ingredients of life. Pyrimidine is a ring-shaped molecule made up of carbon...

>Animated history of planetary detection, from 1750 to 2015. Credit and copyright: Hugh Osborn. The universe is an amazingly large place. It&#8217;s so large that we may sometimes feel as though we are lost in a vast, empty sea. But of course, the cosmos is anything but empty. The universe is populated with asteroids, planets, stars, black holes, and a plethora of other objects. This seems rather obvious; however, we didn&#8217;t always know this. In fact, we didn&#8217;t even discover Pluto until 1930. Then, for more than half a century, the universe was silent. The first exoplanet (a planet that orbits a star in another solar system) wasn&#8217;t detected until 1994. At this point, Dr. Alexander Wolszczan, a radio astronomer at Pennsylvani...
