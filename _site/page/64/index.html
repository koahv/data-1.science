A team led by astronomers from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy has created the first three-dimensional map of the ‘adolescent’ Universe, just 3 billion years after the Big Bang. This map, built from data collected from the W. M. Keck Observatory, is millions of light-years across and provides a tantalizing glimpse of large structures in the ‘cosmic web’ – the backbone of cosmic structure.
On the largest scales, matter in the Universe is arranged in a vast network of filamentary structures known as the ‘cosmic web’, its tangled strands spanning hundreds of millions of light-years. Dark matter, which emits no light, forms the backbone of this web, which is also suffused with primordial hydrogen gas left over from the Big Bang. Galaxies like our own Milky Way are embedded inside this web, but fill only a tiny fraction of its volume.
Now a team of astronomers led by Khee-Gan Lee, a post-doc at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, has created a map of hydrogen absorption revealing a three-dimensional section of the universe 11 billions light years away – the first time the cosmic web has been mapped at such a vast distance. Since observing to such immense distances is also looking back in time, the map reveals the early stages of cosmic structure formation when the Universe was only a quarter of its current age, during an era when the galaxies were undergoing a major ‘growth spurt’.
The map was created by using faint background galaxies as light sources, against which gas could be seen by the characteristic absorption features of hydrogen. The wavelengths of each hydrogen feature showed the presence of gas at a specific distance from us. Combining all of the measurements across the entire field of view allowed the team a tantalizing glimpse of giant filamentary structures extending across millions of light-years, and paves the way for more extensive studies that will reveal not only the structure of the cosmic web, but also details of its function – the ways that pristine gas is funneled along the web into galaxies, providing the raw material for the formation of galaxies, stars, and planets.
Using the light from faint background galaxies for this purpose had been thought impossible with current telescopes – until Lee carried out calculations that suggested otherwise. To ensure success, Lee and his colleagues obtained observing time at Keck Observatory, home of the two largest and most scientifically productive telescopes in the world.
Although bad weather limited the astronomers to observing for only 4 hours, the data they collected with the LRIS instrument was completely unprecedented. “We were pretty disappointed as the weather was terrible and we only managed to collect a few hours of good data. But judging by the data quality as it came off the telescope, it was clear to me that the experiment was going to work,” said Max Plank’s Joseph Hennawi, who was part of the observing team.
“The data were obtained using the LRIS spectrograph on the Keck I telescope,” Lee said. “With its gargantuan 10m-diameter mirror, this telescope effectively collected enough light from our targeted galaxies that are more than 15 billion times fainter than the faintest stars visible to the naked eye. Since we were measuring the dimming of blue light from these distant galaxies caused by the foreground gas, the thin atmosphere at the summit of Mauna Kea allowed more of this blue light to reach the telescope and be measured by the highly sensitive detectors of the LRIS spectrograph. The data we collected would have taken at least several times longer to obtain on any other telescope.”
Their absorption measurements using 24 faint background galaxies provided sufficient coverage of a small patch of the sky to be combined into a 3D map of the foreground cosmic web. A crucial element was the computer algorithm used to create the 3D map: due to the large amount of data, a naïve implementation of the map-making procedure would require an inordinate amount of computing time. Fortunately, team members Casey Stark and Martin White (UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Lab) devised a new fast algorithm that could create the map within minutes. "We realized we could simplify the computations by tailoring it to this particular problem, and thus use much less memory. A calculation that previously required a supercomputer now runs on a laptop", says Stark.
The resulting map of hydrogen absorption reveals a three-dimensional section of the universe 11 billions light years away – this is first time the cosmic web has been mapped at such a vast distance. Since observing to such immense distances is also looking back in time, the map reveals the early stages of cosmic structure formation when the Universe was only a quarter of its current age, during an era when the galaxies were undergoing a major ‘growth spurt’. The map provides a tantalizing glimpse of giant filamentary structures extending across millions of light-years, and paves the way for more extensive studies that will reveal not only the structure of the cosmic web, but also details of its function – the ways that pristine gas is funneled along the web into galaxies, providing the raw material for the formation of galaxies, stars, and planets.
The W. M. Keck Observatory operates the largest, most scientifically productive telescopes on Earth. The two, 10-meter optical/infrared telescopes near the summit of Mauna Kea on the Island of Hawaii feature a suite of advanced instruments including imagers, multi-object spectrographs, high-resolution spectrographs, integral-field spectroscopy and world-leading laser guide star adaptive optics systems.

Previous anecdotal studies suggested that deep-sea animals might avoid dead jellyfish, causing dead jellyfish from blooms to accumulate and undergo slow degradation by microbes, depleting oxygen at the seafloor and depriving fish and invertebrate scavengers.</p>

  <p>A report prepared for the European Commission has found that onshore wind power provides the cheapest source of energy once external factors such as air quality, health impacts and expenditure, and the costs of climate change are taken into consideration. The report’s authors found that onshore wind costs around $133 per MW/h to produce, whereas gas and coal cost up to $208 and $295 per MW/h each. However, continuing a controversy that shadowed the Commission last year, extracts from the report have already been published that fail to include the external costs, which is where many of the subsidies to coal, gas and nuclear are made.</p>

Scientists examining volcanic deposits on the surface of the planet using NASA’s MESSENGER spacecraft found evidence of explosive activity as recently as a billion years ago. Previous studies of the cratering of other lava flows placed most volcanic activity at more than 3.5 billion years in the past.
Rocky planets like Mercury in orbit around other stars could have similar volcanic activity, releasing volatiles useful for the evolution of life at the surface. With temperatures ranging from -280 to 800 degrees Fahrenheit (-173 to 427 degrees Celsius), Mercury is not habitable, but similar rocky bodies around smaller, cooler stars would lie in their star’s habitable zone, the region where liquid water could exist on the surface.
In fact, volcanism on the hot planet bears a strong similarity to volcanism on the Moon, which scientists say is surprising because of their differences.
“Both Mercury and the Moon are a lot smaller than the Earth, and so will have cooled more than Earth since their formation. For that reason, a lot of models would not predict volcanism within the last two billion years,” lead author Rebecca Thomas of The Open University, in the United Kingdom, told Astrobiology Magazine by email.
Kuniyoshi, a fresh crater on Mercury less than a billion years old shown below, contains volcanic vents in its rim and walls. Because the vents would not have survived the impact, scientists concluded they must be younger than the billion-year-old crater. 
 </p>

<p> 
“The fact that they both have evidence for such volcanism, despite their very different internal structures and geological histories, suggests either that our thermal models are wrong, or that there is a common cause for the prolongation of such volcanic activity.”
When NASA’s Mariner 10 flew by Mercury in 1974, it captured features later identified as lava plains created by effusive volcanism, where lava flows from a vent in the ground. In 2009, studies by the MESSENGER probe identified irregular pits on the rocky planet with deposits that were redder than the planetary average when seen in visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Scientists identified the reddish material as pyroclastic deposits formed by explosive volcanism.
After identifying the first pyroclastic deposits, scientists searched other regions for indications of explosive volcanism. Thomas and her team found 150 groups of volcanic pits with bright red deposits to indicate that the lava had violently burst through the crust. Using craters to determine the age of the deposits, they found that they occurred between 4.1 billion years ago— not long after the planet’s birth — up to about a billion years ago.
The volcanos formed aren’t steep-sided cones like those often identified on Earth. Instead, the deposits form a ring around the vent out to approximately 3.5 miles (6 kilometers), and then a zone of thin deposits spread out about three times as far, Thomas said.
Although the deposits Thomas and her team searched for appear redder than the rest of the planet, they are so dark they would look black against the bright surface of the Moon, she said. Ejected material near the vents may have been so hot that it welded together on landing, looking more like lava flows or gobs of melted wax. Farther out, the magma fragments would have had more time to cool before landing, forming small glass spheres that resemble fine beads. On the Moon, these spherules come in many colors, depending on changes in the composition.
“When the Apollo 17 astronauts went to the Moon, they found orange-colored soil, and they realized that tiny glass spheres from a volcanic eruption were what made it look orange,” Laura Kerber, of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told Astrobiology Magazine in an email. Kerber, who was not involved in the new research, studies explosive volcanism on Mars, Mercury and Earth.
Identifying these features on Mercury has been what Kerber calls “a special challenge.” On the Moon, the presence of iron allowed scientists to map different minerals. But on the surface of Mercury, there is so little iron that identifying the composition of the crust is more difficult.
“MESSENGER has several instruments, such as an X-ray spectrometer, and a gamma ray and neutron spectrometer, which allow us to learn about Mercury’s composition in other ways,” Kerber said. “Still, it would be great for us to have a sample of Mercury here on the Earth to study up close. Many amazing discoveries have been made using the pyroclastic beads that the Apollo astronauts brought back from the Moon.”
Although most of the volcanism on Mercury took the form of slow-moving lava, some of it was quite violent. “In explosive volcanism, gases that were originally dissolved in the magma rip it apart when it reaches the lower-pressure conditions of the planet’s surface,” Thomas said.
“Chunks of magma, blocks ripped from the vent wall, and finer ash are ejected violently. On Earth, these would be the most destructive eruptions.”
Kerber compares the process to the physics involved in a carbonated beverage. In a can of soda, the carbon dioxide is pushed into liquid form while under high pressure. When the bottle is opened and the pressure released, bubbles form as the carbon dioxide jumps back into the gas phase.
Materials known as volatiles, elements or compounds likely to enter the gas phase when heated, act similar to the soda’s carbon dioxide. More volatiles result in more gas, making the eruption more likely to be explosive.
In addition, scientists think that an impact early in the planet’s lifetime evaporated most of the crust, vaporizing most of its volatile components. “So the presence of explosive volcanism on Mercury is a little bit surprising,” Kerber said.
While the slow creeping lava from effusive eruptions might bear a strong resemblance to flows seen at the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii,the more explosive eruptions on Mercury would differ from those on Earth.
Mercury is a smaller planet, with lower gravity, which means material ejected from a volcano on the hot rocky planet would fly farther than if it spewed from an Earth-based eruption at the same speed.
Mercury also has almost no atmosphere, compared to the thick one surrounding Earth, which means that there would be no air pressure to keep the gas from spreading. As a result, Kerber said, the gases would expand more rapidly and explosively than they would on Earth. The lack of atmosphere would also keep the particles traveling in a straightforward trajectory, without the effects of turbulence or wind.
“On Mercury, you would not see billowing ash clouds as on Earth. Instead, it would be like a Roman Candle firework, with glowing fragments spraying out in every direction,” Thomas said.
Volcanism can help scientists understand a planet’s composition, internal structure and even how it formed. As Mercury cools, it contracts, creating features known as “wrinkle ridges” as the crust pulls closer together. This contraction, along with the cooling, is one reason scientists thought it unlikely that volcanic activity would have continued into the later part of the planet’s geological history, Thomas said.
Such deposits may be present on exoplanets — planets orbiting other stars — if they, too, are rocky bodies without an atmosphere. According to Kerber, the farther a planet is from a star, the more volatiles it is likely to have. Similarly, larger planets cool slower, also suggesting more volcanic activity.
Recent studies have suggested that rocky planets like Mercury orbiting stars smaller and dimmer than the sun—a class known as ‘M dwarfs’—would be able to host photosynthesis on their surface.
“If an exoplanet of a similar size were in its star’s habitable zone, the heat from the volcanic eruption is a good source of energy, and the volcanic-bearing compounds it releases to the surface can be used as nutrients,” Thomas said.
Exoplanets could also help to clear up the mystery of Mercury’s formation, as scientists come to understand the internal composition of other small, close-orbiting rocky planets.
Mercury stands out from other planets in the Solar System because it has a massive iron core that dominates its interior. Less than 20 percent of the radius of the planet is taken up by the crust and mantle.

Some models propose that the over-sized core is due to an impact early in its life — the same impact that scientists thought would have evaporated the majority of the volatiles when most of the crust and mantle were lost. Most of the iron remained, but in the planet’s core rather than at its surface. Others suggest it formed this way due to its close orbit around the Sun.
“In fact, this is one of the most exciting things we could learn by looking at exoplanets that are also close to their star. Was a planet like Mercury inevitable at that distance from the Sun, or is it the result of a massive catastrophe?” Thomas said.
The research was published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters in September 2014.

NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has provided researchers strong evidence the moon’s volcanic activity slowed gradually instead of stopping abruptly a billion years ago. Scores of distinctive rock deposits observed by LRO are estimated to be less than 100 million years old, scattered across the moon’s dark volcanic plains and are characterized by a mixture of smooth, rounded, shallow mounds next to patches of rough, blocky terrain. This time period corresponds to Earth’s Cretaceous period, the heyday of dinosaurs. Some areas may be less than 50 million years old.
“This finding is the kind of science that is literally going to make geologists rewrite the textbooks about the moon,” said John Keller, LRO project scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.
The features are too small to be seen from Earth, averaging less than a third of a mile (500 meters) across in their largest dimension. One of the largest, a well-studied area called Ina, was imaged from lunar orbit by Apollo 15 astronauts.
Ina appeared to be a one-of-a-kind feature until researchers from Arizona State University in Tempe and Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster in Germany spotted many similar regions in high-resolution images taken by the two Narrow Angle Cameras that are part of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera, or LROC. The team identified a total of 70 irregular mare patches on the near side of the moon. The large number of these features and their wide distribution strongly suggest that late-stage volcanic activity was not an anomaly but an important part of the moon's geologic history.
The numbers and sizes of the craters within these areas indicate the deposits are relatively recent. Based on a technique that links such crater measurements to the ages of Apollo and Luna samples, three of the irregular mare patches are thought to be less than 100 million years old, and perhaps less than 50 million years old in the case of Ina. The steep slopes leading down from the smooth rock layers to the rough terrain are consistent with the young age estimates.In contrast, the volcanic plains surrounding these distinctive regions are attributed to volcanic activity that started about 3 1/2 billion years ago and ended roughly 1 billion years ago. At that point, all volcanic activity on the moon was thought to cease.
Several earlier studies suggested that Ina was quite young and might have formed due to localized volcanic activity. However, in the absence of other similar features, Ina was not considered an indication of widespread volcanism.The findings have major implications for how warm the moon’s interior is thought to be.
“The existence and age of the irregular mare patches tell us that the lunar mantle had to remain hot enough to provide magma for the small-volume eruptions that created these unusual young features,” said Sarah Braden, a recent Arizona State University graduate and the lead author of the study.
The new information is hard to reconcile with what currently is thought about the temperature of the interior of the moon.“These young volcanic features are prime targets for future exploration, both robotic and human,” said Mark Robinson, LROC principal investigator at Arizona State University.
LRO is managed by Goddard for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. LROC, a system of three cameras, was designed and built by Malin Space Science Systems and is operated by Arizona State University.
The image at the top of the page shows a feature called Maskelyne, one of many newly discovered young volcanic deposits on the Moon. Called irregular mare patches, these areas are thought to be remnants of small basaltic eruptions that occurred much later than the commonly accepted end of lunar volcanism, 1 to 1.5 billion years ago.

  <p>The results of a four-year international study of 2060 cardiac arrest cases across 15 hospitals concludes the following. The themes relating to the experience of death appear far broader than what has been understood so far, or what has been described as so called near-death experiences. In some cases of cardiac arrest, memories of visual awareness compatible with so called out-of-body experiences may correspond with actual events. A higher proportion of people may have vivid death experiences, but do not recall them due to the effects of brain injury or sedative drugs on memory circuits. Widely used yet scientifically imprecise terms such as near-death and out-of-body experiences may not be sufficient to describe the actual experience of death. The recalled experience surrounding death merits a genuine investigation without prejudice.</p>

  <p>The 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to John O´Keefe, May-Britt Moser and Edvard I. Moser for their discoveries of cells that constitute a positioning system in the brain. The discoveries have solved a problem that has occupied philosophers and scientists for centuries – how does the brain create a map of the space surrounding us and how can we navigate our way through a complex environment?</p>

  <p>Scientists have taken pictures of the BRCA2 protein for the first time, showing how it works to repair damaged DNA. The findings showed that each pair of BRCA2 proteins binds two sets of RAD51 that run in opposite directions. This allows it to work on strands of broken DNA that point in either direction. They also show that BRCA2’s job is to help RAD51 form short filaments at multiple sites along the DNA, presumably to increase the efficiency of establishing longer filaments required to search for matching strands.</p>
