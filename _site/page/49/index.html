  <p>(Phys.org)—As an elementary particle, the electron cannot be broken down into smaller particles, at least as far as is currently known. However, in a phenomenon called electron fractionalization, in certain materials an electron can be broken down into smaller “charge pulses,” each of which carries a fraction of the electron’s charge. Although electron fractionalization has many interesting implications, its origins are not well understood.</p>

Carl Sagan chatted about this idea of solar sailing on a 1976 talk show, and the idea moved into more significant phases and hard work. Since the talk show, Prof. Sagan founded the Planetary Society; Bill Nye joined, and said in a video that they are about to realize Prof. Sagan’s vision. LightSail now has a 32-square-meter sails using extraordinarily thin mylar, said Nye, the Planetary Society’s CEO.</p>

After an epic journey across the breadth of the solar system, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft is finally nearing its destination: the Pluto system, a staggering 3 billion miles from Earth. In December, after a journey of nine years, the spacecraft was brought out of hibernation for the last time in preparation for its rendezvous with the dwarf planet the week of July 12. The upcoming Pluto flyby, once billed as the ‘first trip to the last planet,’ is actually the first visit to an entirely new class of worlds, says planetary scientist William McKinnon.
Asked if he is excited, William McKinnon, PhD, a planetary scientist in Arts &amp; Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis who is a co-investigator on the science team of New Horizons, said, “How can I answer that question? We’ve been trying to do this for 25 years, and now it’s all of a sudden happening. It kind of seems a little unreal. Like, is this really happening?”
The last such “first encounter” with a planet was in 1989, when Voyager 2 took a look at Neptune on its way out of the solar system. Half the people in the United States are too young to remember that flyby.
“Old-timers like me remember these first encounters and how fascinating they were,” McKinnon said. “I can remember looking at the newspaper as a boy on the floor of my parents’ living room at the first pictures of Mars sent from Mariner 4, which were grainy and showed craters. Something of a disappointment; nobody waving,” he said, with characteristic deadpan humor.
“But all of the first encounters with the giant planets and their satellites were really fascinating,” he said. “The sheer strangeness of these places, which became real worlds once we could see them, was fascinating to me. So this first encounter will be fun.”
When New Horizons was launched, Pluto was called a planet and Charon was Pluto’s only known moon. In 2006, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet, and the Hubble Telescope has since found four more moons orbiting Pluto: Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx.
“In the 1980s, light-sensitive, charge-coupled detectors (CCDs) came over from the military and they could see much fainter objects than chemically sensitized photographic plates,” McKinnon said. In 1992, using a CCD attached to a telescope, astronomers David Jewitt and Jane Luu discovered the first Kuiper Belt object. Six months later they found another one. “Then everyone ran to the telescope,” McKinnon said.
The New Horizons page curated by the Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory, which manages the mission for NASA, has the latest images of Pluto.
Today there are more than 2,000 catalogued bodies in the Kuiper Belt, including several that qualify as dwarf planets. “That’s enough that we can see the structure of the belt,” McKinnon said. “And the best — maybe the only — way to explain that structure is to revise our notion of how the planets coalesced and settled into their orbits.
“We were all taught, or assumed for simplicity, that the giant planets in the outer solar system formed more or less where they are and sat there for the rest of time,” McKinnon said. “But people who made models of the gas giants forming couldn’t make them sit still because there’s too much exchange of energy and momentum among them and smaller bodies.”
In 2005, an international group of astronomers working in Nice, France, proposed that the giant planets originally formed much closer to Jupiter, the gas giant closest to the sun, but then moved outward, eventually hitting a mutual gravitational sweet spot that sent Neptune rocketing into the belt of planetesimals (bits and pieces of planetary stuff) that ringed the solar system.
According to the “Nice model,” the giant planets once orbited much closer to Jupiter (Jupiter’s orbit is shown in green) than they do today. Through a series of gravitational interactions, Uranus (light blue) and Neptune (dark blue) were sent flying into the planetesimals ringing the solar system, scattering 99 percent of them out of the belt.
                         
                  The errant Neptune threw the belt into chaos. It locked some of the bodies into orbital resonances with itself and, with the aid of the other giant planets, hurled most of them out of the solar system, or caused them to collide with one another or one of the planets, including Earth. When the dust settled, the orbital resonances formed the inner and outer boundaries of a depopulated belt of stable orbits.
“Today when you make detailed computer models of the solar system’s formation,” McKinnon said, “you get something that actually looks like the Kuiper Belt today.”
So our understanding of Pluto has been completely revised while New Horizons has been speeding toward its rendezvous. The ninth planet by 20th-century reckoning has become the first of a new, third class of planets in the 21st century, transforming our understanding of how the solar system formed. Big deeds for a small planet.

A new study from the University of Cambridge has identified one of the oldest fossil brains ever discovered - more than 500 million years old - and used it to help determine how heads first evolved in early animals. The results, published today (7 May) in the journal Current Biology, identify a key point in the evolutionary transition from soft to hard bodies in early ancestors of arthropods, the group that contains modern insects, crustaceans and spiders.
The study looked at two types of arthropod ancestors - a soft-bodied trilobite and a bizarre creature resembling a submarine. It found that a hard plate, called the anterior sclerite, and eye-like features at the front of their bodies were connected through nerve traces originating from the front part of the brain, which corresponds with how vision is controlled in modern arthropods. The image above is Odaraia alata, an arthropod resembling a submarine from the middle Cambrian Burgess Shale.
The new results also allowed new comparisons with anomalocaridids, a group of large swimming predators of the period, and found key similarities between the anterior sclerite and a plate on the top of the anomalocaridid head, suggesting that they had a common origin. Although it is widely agreed that anomalocaridids are early arthropod ancestors, their bodies are actually quite different. Thanks to the preserved brains in these fossils, it is now possible to recognise the anterior sclerite as a bridge between the head of anomalocaridids and that of more familiar jointed arthropods.
“The anterior sclerite has been lost in modern arthropods, as it most likely fused with other parts of the head during the evolutionary history of the group,” said Dr Javier Ortega-Hernández, a postdoctoral researcher from Cambridge’s Department of Earth Sciences, who authored the study. “What we’re seeing in these fossils is one of the major transitional steps between soft-bodied worm-like creatures and arthropods with hard exoskeletons and jointed limbs - this is a period of crucial transformation.”
Ortega-Hernández observed that bright spots at the front of the bodies, which are in fact simple photoreceptors, are embedded into the anterior sclerite. The photoreceptors are connected to the front part of the fossilised brain, very much like the arrangement in modern arthropods. In all likelihood these ancient brains processed information like in today’s arthropods, and were crucial for interacting with the environment, detecting food, and escaping from predators.
During the Cambrian Explosion, a period of rapid evolutionary innovation about 500 million years ago when most major animal groups emerge in the fossil record, arthropods with hard exoskeletons and jointed limbs first started to appear. Prior to this period, most animal life on Earth consisted of enigmatic soft-bodied creatures that resembled algae or jellyfish.
These fossils, from the collections of the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, originated from the Burgess Shale in Western Canada, one of the world’s richest source of fossils from the period.
Since brains and other soft tissues are essentially made of fatty-like substances, finding them as fossils is extremely rare, which makes understanding their evolutionary history difficult. Even in the Burgess Shale, one of the rare places on Earth where conditions are just right to enable exceptionally good preservation of Cambrian fossils, finding fossilised brain tissue is very uncommon. In fact, this is the most complete brain found in a fossil from the Burgess Shale, as earlier results have been less conclusive.
“Heads have become more complex over time,” said Ortega-Hernández, who is a Fellow of Emmanuel College. “But what we’re seeing here is an answer to the question of how arthropods changed their bodies from soft to hard. It gives us an improved understanding of the origins and complex evolutionary history of this highly successful group.”

New observations of a recently exploded star are confirming supercomputer model predictions made at Caltech that the deaths of stellar giants are lopsided affairs in which debris and the stars’ cores hurtle off in opposite directions.
While observing the remnant of supernova (SN) 1987A, NASA’s Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuSTAR, recently detected the unique energy signature of titanium-44, a radioactive version of titanium that is produced during the early stages of a particular type of star explosion, called a Type II, or core-collapse supernova.
“Titanium-44 is unstable. When it decays and turns into calcium, it emits gamma rays at a specific energy, which NuSTAR can detect,” says Fiona Harrison, the Benjamin M. Rosen Professor of Physics at Caltech, and NuSTAR’s principal investigator.
By analyzing direction-dependent frequency changes–or Doppler shifts–of energy from titanium-44, Harrison and her team discovered that most of the material is moving away from NuSTAR. The finding, detailed in the May 8 issue of the journal Science, is the best proof yet that the mechanism that triggers Type II supernovae is inherently lopsided.
NuSTAR recently created detailed titanium-44 maps of another supernova remnant, called Cassiopeia A, and there too it found signs of an asymmetrical explosion, although the evidence in this case is not as definitive as with 1987A.
Supernova 1987A was first detected in 1987, when light from the explosion of a blue supergiant star located 168,000 light-years away reached Earth. SN 1987A was an important event for astronomers. Not only was it the closest supernova to be detected in hundreds of years, it marked the first time that neutrinos had been detected from an astronomical source other than our sun.
These nearly massless subatomic particles had been predicted to be produced in large quantities during Type II explosions, so their detection during 1987A supported some of the fundamental theories about the inner workings of supernovae.
With the latest NuSTAR observations, 1987A is once again proving to be a useful natural laboratory for studying the mysteries of stellar death. For many years, supercomputer simulations performed at Caltech and elsewhere predicted that the cores of pending Type II supernovae change shape just before exploding, transforming from a perfectly symmetric sphere into a wobbly mass made up of turbulent plumes of extremely hot gas. In fact, models that assumed a perfectly spherical core just fizzled out.
“If you make everything just spherical, the core doesn’t explode. It turns out you need asymmetries to make the star explode,” Harrison says.
According to the simulations, the shape change is driven by turbulence generated by neutrinos that are absorbed within the core. “This turbulence helps push out a powerful shock wave and launch the explosion,” says Christian Ott, a professor of theoretical physics at Caltech who was not involved in the NuSTAR observations.
Ott’s team uses supercomputers to run three-dimensional simulations of core-collapse supernovae. Each simulation generates hundreds of terabytes of results–for comparison, the entire print collection of the U.S. Library of Congress is equal to about 10 terabytes–but represents only a few tenths of a second during a supernova explosion.
A better understanding of the asymmetrical nature of Type II supernovae, Ott says, could help solve one of the biggest mysteries surrounding stellar deaths: why some supernovae collapse into neutron stars and others into a black hole to form a space-time singularity. It could be that the high degree of asymmetry in some supernovae produces a dual effect: the star explodes in one direction, while the remainder of the star continues to collapse in all other directions.
“In this way, an explosion could happen, but eventually leave behind a black hole and not a neutron star,” Ott says.
The NuSTAR findings also increase the chances that Advanced LIGO–the upgraded version of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory, which will begin to take data later this year–will be successful in detecting gravitational waves from supernovae. Gravitational waves are ripples that propagate through the fabric of space-time. According to theory, Type II supernovae should emit gravitational waves, but only if the explosions are asymmetrical.
Harrison and Ott have plans to combine the observational and theoretical studies of supernova that until now have been occurring along parallel tracks at Caltech, using the NuSTAR observations to refine supercomputer simulations of supernova explosions.
“The two of us are going to work together to try to get the models to more accurately predict what we’re seeing in 1987A and Cassiopeia A,” Harrison says.

We know Enceledus has liquid water by its cryovolcanoes. There are other ways we can tell if a moon has a water interior, but one of the more interesting methods is to look at a moon’s aurora. This approach was recently used to show that Jupiter’s moon Ganymede has more liquid water than Earth.
You might have seen an aurora on Earth when there has been a rise in solar activity. On Earth, the aurora (or northern lights) are caused by charged particles emitted by solar flares that interact with Earth’s magnetic field. When a charge enters Earth’s magnetic field, the magnetic field causes the charge to spiral along the magnetic field. For this reason magnetic fields tend to trap charges along their field lines. The charges generally stay trapped unless they collide with each other (not likely in interstellar space) or interact with something else, such as our atmosphere. Where the particles strike our atmosphere depends upon the energy of the charged particles, and thus the activity level of the Sun. As the activity level of the Sun varies, the latitude at which aurora are most prominent can vary.
Aurora have been observed on other planets, as well as moons such as Ganymede. The difference is that the aurora of Ganymede are driven by the interaction with Jupiter’s magnetic field rather than the Sun. The process is much the same as aurora on Earth, but the latitude at which they are observed depends upon fluctuations of Jupiter’s magnetic activity. This has been known for a while, but in this new work the team demonstrated that the latitude variations of Ganymede’s aurora can be used to study the moon’s interior.
Since Ganymede’s aurora are driven by the activity of Jupiter, the team could calculate the amount of variation one would expect given the strength of Ganymede’s magnetic field, giving a variation of about 6 degrees. However, the observed variation is only about two degrees. It would seem that something is dampening latitudinal oscillation of the aurora. One mechanism for this kind of dampening is an interior ocean of saline water. Salt water is a good conductor of electricity, so as Jupiter’s magnetic field varies, it induces a magnetic field in addition to Ganymede’s regular magnetic field. As a result, there are less latitudinal fluctuations in aurora.

The team created a model of this interior ocean. They found that without an ocean there would be a fluctuation of about 6 degrees, but with an interior ocean the fluctuations are lessened. Given an observed fluctuation of about 2 degrees, the interior ocean would need to be about 100 kilometers thick, starting about 150 kilometers beneath the moon’s surface. That means Ganymede has about 70% more water than Earth.

New data from MESSENGER, the spacecraft that orbited Mercury for four years before crashing into the planet a week ago, reveals Mercury’s magnetic field is almost four billion years old. The discovery helps scientists piece together the history of Mercury, the closest planet to the sun and one about which we knew very little before MESSENGER.
NASA’s MESSENGER probe left Earth in 2004, reached Mercury in 2008 and has orbited the planet since 2011, sending valuable data back to scientists. A study detailing the planet’s ancient magnetic field was published today in Science Express. Researchers used data obtained by MESSENGER in the fall of 2014 and 2015 when the probe flew incredibly close to the planet’s surface - at altitudes as low as 15 kilometers. In the years prior, MESSENGER’s lowest altitudes were between 200 and 400 kilometers.
“The mission was originally planned to last one year; no one expected it to go for four,” said Catherine Johnson, a University of British Columbia planetary scientist and lead author of the study. “The science from these recent observations is really interesting and what we’ve learned about the magnetic field is just the first part of it.”
Scientists have known for some time that Mercury has a magnetic field similar to Earth’s, but much weaker. The motion of liquid iron deep inside the planet’s core generates the field.
Mercury is the only other planet besides Earth in the inner solar system with such a magnetic field. There is evidence that Mars once had a magnetic field but it disappeared at some point over 3 billion years ago.
When MESSENGER flew close to the planet, its magnetometer collected data on the magnetism of rocks in Mercury’s surface. Those tiny signals revealed that Mercury’s magnetic field is very ancient, between 3.7 and 3.9 billion years old. The planet itself formed around the same time as Earth, just over 4.5 billion years ago.
“If we didn’t have these recent observations, we would never have known how Mercury’s magnetic field evolved over time,” said Johnson, also a scientist at the Planetary Science Institute. “It’s just been waiting to tell us its story.”
One of the biggest challenges of the MESSENGER mission was getting the spacecraft into orbit around Mercury. Because the planet is so close to the sun, there was a risk that the spacecraft would get pulled into the sun, rather than go into orbit around Mercury. Engineers also had to deal with the issue of high temperatures.
MESSENGER was designed with a protective sunshield to keep the side of the spacecraft facing the sun cool. The engineers also designed large elliptical orbits around Mercury that allowed the spacecraft to spend time far from the planet in each orbit and cool off. Between 2011 and 2015, MESSENGER completed over 4,000 orbits of the planet.

“The reaction between the metallic rocks and the ocean water produces molecular hydrogen (H2) provides a source of chemical energy that is essential for supporting a deep biosphere in the absence of sunlight inside moons and planets,” said Christopher Glein of the Carnegie Institute. “This process is central to the emerging science of astrobiology, because molecular hydrogen can both drive the formation of organic compounds like amino acids that may lead to the origin of life, and serve as food for microbial life such as methane-producing organisms. As such, serpentinization provides a link between geological processes and biological processes. The discovery of serpentinization makes Enceladus an even more promising candidate for a separate genesis of life.”
New research led by Glein has revealed the pH of water spewing from a geyser-like plume on Saturn’s moon Enceladus. Their findings are an important step toward determining whether life could exist, or could have previously existed, on the sixth planet’s sixth-largest moon. The diagram below illustrates the possible interior of Saturn’s moon Enceladus, including the ocean and plumes in the south polar region, was based on Cassini spacecraft observations, courtesy of NASA/JPL-Caltech.
 </p>

<p> 
 
Enceladus is geologically active and thought to have a liquid water ocean beneath its icy surface. The hidden ocean is the presumed source of the plume of water vapor and ice that the Cassini spacecraft has observed venting from the moon’s south polar region. Whenever there’s the possibility of liquid water on another planetary body, scientists begin to ask whether or not it could support life.
The present team, including lead author Glein, John Baross of the University of Washington, and J. Hunter Waite Jr. of the Southwest Research Institute, developed a new chemical model based on mass spectrometry data of ice grains and gases in Enceladus’ plume gathered by Cassini, in order to determine the pH of Enceladus’ ocean. The pH tells us how acidic or basic the water is. It is a fundamental parameter to understanding geochemical processes occurring inside the moon that are considered important in determining Enceladus’ potential for acquiring and hosting life. Their work is published in the journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta.
The team’s model, constrained by observational data from two Cassini teams, including one led by coauthor Waite, shows that the plume, and by inference the ocean, is salty with an alkaline pH of about 11 or 12, which is similar to that of glass-cleaning solutions of ammonia. It contains the same sodium chloride (NaCl) salt as our oceans here on Earth. Its additional substantial sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) makes the ocean more similar to our planet’s soda lakes such as Mono Lake in California or Lake Magadi in Kenya. The scientists refer to it as a “soda ocean.”
“Knowledge of the pH improves our understanding of geochemical processes in Enceladus’ ‘soda ocean,’” Glein explained.
The model suggests that the ocean’s high pH is caused by a metamorphic, underwater geochemical process called serpentinization. On Earth, serpentinization occurs when certain kinds of so-called “ultrabasic” or “ultramafic” rocks (low in silica and high in magnesium and iron) are brought up to the ocean floor from the upper mantle and chemically interact with the surrounding water molecules. Through this process, the ultrabasic rocks are converted into new minerals, including the mineral serpentine, after which the process is named, and the fluid becomes alkaline. On Enceladus, serpentinization would occur when ocean water circulates through a rocky core at the bottom of its ocean.
Even beyond the search for life-hosting conditions on other planetary bodies, the team’s work demonstrates that it is possible to determine the pH of an extraterrestrial ocean based on chemical data from a spacecraft flying through a plume. This may be a useful approach to searching for habitable conditions in other icy worlds, such as Jupiter’s moon Europa.
“Our results show that this kind of synergy between observations and modeling can tell us a great deal about the geochemical processes occurring on a faraway celestial object, thus opening the door to an exciting new era of chemical oceanography in the solar system and beyond.” Glein added.
This work was supported by the Deep Carbon Observatory, the Carnegie Institution for Science, the NASA Astrobiology Institute, and the Cassini Project.
