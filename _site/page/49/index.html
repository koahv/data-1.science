When one thing comes into balance, another gets thrown out of whack. In this case it looks like the ozone layer is finally starting to get fixed up while greenhouse gases are hitting dangerously high levels. According to Engadget and a paper from NASA’s Goddard Space Center, the ozone layer that protects us from the sun’s harmful rays is starting to heal. And at the same time, data from NOAA reveals that the global month average for airborne carbon dioxide is now 400 parts per million (ppm) – or 50 ppm beyond the United Nation’s “safe limit” for atmospheric carbon.

As a series of islands, climate change poses a very present threat and, since they are dependent on oil for energy, they have to import a lot of it.
