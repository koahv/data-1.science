<p>A new computer called the “HummingBoard” takes on the same basic shape as the Raspberry Pi but uses a more powerful processor and supports more operating systems.
SolidRun, which also makes the CuBox-i computer we wrote about, just started selling the HummingBoard in several configurations ranging from $45 to $100, not including the price of a power adapter and Micro SD card.</p>

<p>“The HummingBoard allows you to run many open source operating systems—such as Ubuntu, Debian, and Arch—as well as Android and XBMC,” SolidRun says. “With its core technology based on SolidRun’s state-of-the-art Micro System on a Module (MicroSOM), it has ready-to-use OS images, and its open hardware comes with full schematics and layout. Best of all, as a Linux single board computer, the HummingBoard is backed by the global digital maker community, which means you can alter the product in any way you like and get full kernel upstreaming support and all the assistance you need.”

<p>Take a second and look around you. I’m willing to bet that you have at least half a dozen objects in your immediate vicinity use electricity in some way to power its systems. Maybe you’re using a battery or you’re plugged directly into an outlet, but either way, this energy came to you via coal/wind/solar/geothermal or a host of other methods we use to generate power here on earth. Well, what about our spacecrafts? How do they get the power they need? It depends on where they are in the solar system.
For spacecraft operating inside the inner solar system (including earth orbit), the traditional power source is solar. Solar panels (also called photovoltaics) convert light energy into usable electrical energy. They accomplish this feat because each solar panel is made up of individual solar cells. Each cell has a semiconductor, which in turn is wired to a circuit. As light hits the semiconductors, the light in converted into electricity and voilà, we have power. Because solar panels require light to work they are usually designed to be independent so they face the sun regardless of the direction the spacecraft is moving or pointing. As a general rule, these spacecraft are also equipped with small batteries in case it is eclipsed from the sun. These batteries are then recharged by the solar array when this eclipse is over.
These solar panels give spacecraft like the International Space Station and the Hubble Space Telescope that iconic look. But, what about spacecraft like Cassini, Galileo, and Juno? These crafts don’t have solar panels. That’s because, as you move further away from the sun (into the outer solar system and beyond), solar power starts getting too weak to use. Instead, these spacecraft use power from a Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG). This fancily named device generates electricity obtained from the radioactive decay of isotopes. RTGs convert this decay into electricity by an array of thermocouples. A thermocouple is a device which converts thermal energy into electrical energy by the conductivity of two metals. When these metals are at different temperatures and connected to each other in a closed loop, electrical current flows between them. Energy which is then harnessed by the spacecraft.
So if ever you were wondering how these amazing vessels get the power to do what they do, well, now you know.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“No matter what your age or your life path … it is not too late or too egotistical or too selfish or too silly to work on your creativity.”
“Art is not a thing — it is a way,” Elbert Hubbard wrote in 1908. But the question of what that way is, where exactly it leads, and how to best follow it is something artists have been grappling with since the dawn of recorded time and psychologists have spent decades trying to decode, outlining the stages of creativity, its essential conditions, and the best technique for producing ideas.
In 1978, a few months after she stopped drinking, artist, poet, playwright, novelist, filmmaker, composer, and journalist Julia Cameron began teaching artists — by the broadest possible definition — how to overcome creative block and get back on their feet after a “creative injury.” What began as one-on-one lessons with a handful of artists became a larger workshop, then a course, which Cameron was invited to teach around the world, and eventually The Artist’s Way (public library) — a seminal, much-beloved handbook on the creative life, exploring its gateways, its obstacles, and how we can get out of our own way. It’s at once a practical set of techniques and a timeless philosophical meditation on the quintessential human impulse to create.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Art by Sydney Pink from ‘Overcoming Creative Block.’ Click image for more.</p>

<p>Writing in the introduction to the 10th anniversary edition, Cameron adds to the most beautiful definitions of art:
Art is a spiritual transaction. Artists are visionaries. We routinely practice a form of faith, seeing clearly and moving toward a creative goal that shimmers in the distance — often visible to us, but invisible to those around us. Difficult as it is to remember, it is our work that creates the market, not the market that creates our work. Art is an act of faith, and we practice practicing it.
Indeed, while there is a strong spiritual overtone to the book that can feel off-putting to those of us skeptical of organized religion, Cameron takes care to invite the broadest possible definition of spirituality, echoing Flannery O’Connor and pointing out that it need not be one aligned with religion at all. She writes:
Think of it as an exercise in open-mindedness. . . . Remind yourself that to succeed in this course, no god concept is necessary. In fact, many of our commonly held god concepts get in the way. Do not allow semantics to become one more block for you. When the word God is used in these pages, you may substitute the thought good orderly direction or flow. What we are talking about is a creative energy. . . . There seems to be no need to name it unless that name is a useful shorthand for what you experience.</p>

<p>That creative energy, Cameron argues, is part of our core nature. Rather than learning it, we simply need to unlearn all the techniques we’ve acquired for blocking it in the course of living our Serious Adult Lives. She writes:
No matter what your age or your life path, whether making art is your career or your hobby or your dream, it is not too late or too egotistical or too selfish or too silly to work on your creativity. . . . I have come to believe that creativity is our true nature, that blocks are an unnatural thwarting of a process at once as normal and as miraculous as the blossoming of a flower at the end of a slender green stem.
Like T.S. Eliot, who extolled the mystical quality of creativity, Cameron recounts her own journey of learning to unblock that natural creative flow — the life-force Dylan Thomas memorably called “the force that through the green fuse drives the flower” — and considers the nonjudgmental mind necessary for true creative work:
I learned to turn my creativity over to the only god I could believe in, the god of creativity, I learned to get out of the way and let that creative force work through me… I learned to just show up at the page and write down what I heard. Writing became more like eavesdropping and less like inventing a nuclear bomb. It wasn’t so tricky, and it didn’t blow up on me anymore. I didn’t have to be in the mood. I didn’t have to take my emotional temperature to see if inspiration was pending. I simply wrote. No negotiations. Good, bad? None of my business. I wasn’t doing it. By resigning as the self-conscious author, I wrote freely.
This concept of surrender seems closer to Eastern philosophical teachings about the unity of the universe than it is to the Western notion of divinity in the religious sense. Cameron writes:
If you think of the universe as a vast electrical sea in which you are immersed and from which you are formed, opening to your creativity changes you from something bobbing in that sea to a more fully functioning, more conscious, more cooperative part of that ecosystem.</p>

<p>And yet, with a hint of Wattsian distinction between belief and faith, Cameron makes a case for the “spiritual electricity” implicit to the creative process and writes:
The heart of creativity is an experience of the mystical union; the heart of the mystical union is an experience of creativity. . . . Creativity is an experience — to my eye, a spiritual experience. It does not matter which way you think of it: creativity leading to spirituality or spirituality leading to creativity. In fact, I do not make a distinction between the two. In the face of such experience, the whole question of belief is rendered obsolete. As Carl Jung answered the question of belief late in his life, “I don’t believe; I know.”
This circular relationship between creativity and spirituality, Cameron argues, is paralleled by the techniques and practices of her “unblocking method.” In a wonderfully reassuring passage, she writes of the “spiral path” toward creative recovery:
You will circle through some of the issues over and over, each time at a different level. There is no such thing as being done with an artistic life. Frustrations and rewards exist at all levels on the path. Our aim here is to find the trail, establish our footing, and begin the climb.
But despite the spiral nature of the path, Cameron draws on her extensive experience of working with artists to outline several stages of the creative recovery process — stages strikingly similar to those of grief, perhaps because the process itself necessitates that we let go of the attachments and psychoemotional habits that stand in the way of our contact with creative energy. Cameron writes:
While there is no quick fix for instant, pain-free creativity, creative recovery (or discovery) is a teachable, trackable spiritual process. Each of us is complex and highly individual, yet there are common recognizable denominators to the creative recovery process. 
Working with this process, I see a certain amount of defiance and giddiness in the first few weeks. This entry stage is followed closely by explosive anger in the course’s midsection. The anger is followed by grief, then alternating waves of resistance and hope. This peaks-and-valleys phase of growth becomes a series of expansions and contractions, a birthing process in which students experience intense elation and defensive skepticism.
This choppy growth phase is followed by a strong urge to abandon the process and return to life as we know it. In other words, a bargaining period. People are often tempted to abandon the course at this point. I call this a creative U-turn. Re-commitment to the process next triggers the free-fall of a major ego surrender. Following this, the final phase of the course is characterized by a new sense of self marked by increased autonomy, resilience, expectancy, and excitement—as well as by the capacity to make and execute concrete creative plans.
If this sounds like a lot of emotional tumult, it is. When we engage in a creativity recovery, we enter into a withdrawal process from life as we know it. Withdrawal is another way of saying detachment or nonattachment, which is emblematic of consistent work with any meditation practice.</p>

<p>Illustration by Lisbeth Zwerger for ‘Alice in Wonderland.’ Click image for more.</p>

<p>But Cameron’s most salient and empowering point is about the direction of the withdrawal:
We ourselves are the substance we withdraw to, not from, as we pull our overextended and misplaced creative energy back into our own core.
What stands between us and that return to our core is the chronic perfectionism against which Anne Lamott so eloquently admonished. Cameron writes:
We are victims of our own internalized perfectionist, a nasty internal and eternal critic, the Censor, who resides in our (left) brain and keeps up a constant stream of subversive remarks that are often disguised as the truth. . . . Make this a rule: always remember that your Censor’s negative opinions are not the truth. This takes practice. By spilling out of bed and straight onto the page every morning, you learn to evade the Censor.
In the remainder of The Artist’s Way, Cameron becomes the trusted sherpa on “an intensive, guided encounter with your own creativity — your private villains, champions, wishes, fears, dreams, hopes, and triumphs” — the kind of experience that will “make you excited, depressed, angry, afraid, joyous, hopeful, and, ultimately, more free.” Complement it with Lamott’s indispensable Bird by Bird, Neil Gaiman on making great art, and Anna Deavere Smith on what creative confidence really means.</p>

<p>The theory on animal behavior for most of history was this: people think and feel; other animals do not. It’s only in recent years that there’s been a sea change in the field of animal cognition, where, previously, there was almost no field at all. As The New York Times Magazine reports, animals studied in zoos seem to contain an emotional spectrum that could populate “a veritable Russian novel.” Research into animal behavior is suddenly less about “Can this animal feel?” and more about “What is this animal feeling?” The answer could be a dolphin seeing itself in a mirror, an OCD brown bear, or a depressed red panda that’ll break your heart.</p>

  <p>Those other senses most don’t know about (via: Finer Minds - See a larger image)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As humans, we have five primary senses. These include sight, sound, smell, taste ,and touch, along with another few lesser-known ones. We use these senses to derive sensory information about our surroundings. Obviously, these senses aren’t unique to humans. In fact, over the years, we’ve found that creatures throughout the animal kingdom use very fascinating mechanisms to derive this same information. Granted, certain senses are more profound on other species (like sight, for instance. we know that many creatures can see in infrared), and many species have senses that work differently than ours do. Plants aren’t an exception to this rule.
Recently, a team of researchers published a paper suggesting that the senses of plants are far more advanced than what was previously thought. Not only that, but they have the capability to identify certain sounds – like the sounds of insects that chew leaves – and respond accordingly.
“Previous research has investigated how plants respond to acoustic energy, including music,” said Heidi Appel, a research scientist from the Division of Plant Sciences in the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources.</p>

<p>“However, our work is the first example of how plants respond to an ecologically relevant vibration. We found that “feeding vibrations” signal changes in the plant cells’ metabolism, creating more defensive chemicals that can repel attacks from caterpillars.”</p>

<p> [Reference: University of MU]</p>

<p>A caterpillar feeding on an Arabidopsis plant (Credit: Roger Meissen)</p>

<p>In order to come to this conclusion, Appel and a collaborator from the Division of Biological Sciences at MU placed caterpillars on Arabidopsis (a genus in the Brassicaceae family, related to both cabbage and mustard) fitted with a small piece of reflective material. They then pointed a laser at the reflective material, subsequently measuring how the leaf slightly shifted in position as the caterpillar chewed.</p>

<p>After those measurements were recorded, they played one set of plants the recordings that were set to vibrations mimicking the feeding; they left another group of plants in complete silence.  Later on, they allowed the caterpillars to feed on both groups, learning that the plants who had heard the vibrations produced substantially MORE mustard oil (a chemical the caterpillars find repulsive).</p>

<p>“What is remarkable is that the plants exposed to different vibrations, including those made by a gentle wind or different insect sounds that share some acoustic features with caterpillar feeding vibrations did not increase their chemical defenses,” Cocroft said.  “This indicates that the plants are able to distinguish feeding vibrations from other common sources of environmental vibration.’”</p>

<p>In the future, the men will focus their attentions on determining how the plants pick up on the vibrations. They also hope to learn exactly which complex vibrational signal is the most important (along with how powerful each of them are), which, by proxy, might reveal how each of the mechanical vibrations they feel interact with other sensory information. It’s especially important to learn exactly how they use this information to enact the protective responses the researchers witnessed against pests and potential threats.
“Plants have many ways to detect insect attack, but feeding vibrations are likely the fastest way for distant parts of the plant to perceive the attack and begin to increase their defenses,” Cocroft said.
Prior to this study, we knew that plants react to wind, touch and even pressure, but the insight into how audio, vibrational and chemical information collaborate is brand new and might even be most important when it comes to understanding plants defense mechanisms.
“Caterpillars react to this chemical defense by crawling away, so using vibrations to enhance plant defenses could be useful to agriculture,’” Appel added.
It’s an extremely cool revelation because it blasts open the floodgates for additional research into plant behavior, potentially showing that “plants have many of the same responses to outside influences that animals do, even though the responses look different.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The study, called “Plants respond to leaf vibrations caused by insect herbivore chewing,”was recently published in the peer-review journal, Oecologia.</p>

  <p>When we think about our solar system, most of our mind’s likely wander to Jupiter’s immensely large storm, or Saturn’s fantastical rings. Perhaps some picture Neptune’s deep blue hue, or its sea of liquid diamond. The point being, these huge objects capture our imagination because they are so far-flung from Earthly sights, like the rolling seas of blue and green and the rocks that crunch beneath our shoes. We kind of take advantage of the fact that the vast majority of planets are composed almost entirely of gas; our solar system included. This handy graphic by XKCD helps drive this point home:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Credit: XKCD</p>

<p>Here, in a piece called “Space Without the Space,” XKCD’s Randall Munroe stitched together an old school, pirate-like map that shows all of the solid ground in our solar system, leaving out speculative estimates of the surface area of any solid “ground” we might find deep within the core of each of our gas-giants. Earth clearly wins hands down, though it’s unclear as to how Munroe incorporated the oceans of Earth in the map. Venus comes in at a close second, which isn’t surprising since it’s very similar to Earth in size (and composition, but that’s another matter all together). Then we have the other rocky bodies, Mercury and Mars. What might be surprising to some is just how similar in size the planets are to some of the moons. Three out of four of the Galilean moons (Callisto, Ganymede and Io) take up a considerable amount of space available on the map. Ganymede, in particular, is the largest of which. It’s actually a bit larger than the inner-most planet from the Sun, Mercury (it’s not that much smaller than Mars, for that fact). It even appears as if all of the dwarf-planets (pictured near the bottom) could fit inside any of the three largest Galilean moons.</p>

<p>A comparison of Mars, Mercury, the Moon and Ganymede (Credit: NASA/SolStation)</p>

<p>It’s also neat that he grouped asteroids, comets and other small moons together. They comprise a small, but notable fraction of the rock found within our solar system. I’m not sure which point of view is cooler: the fact that there are so many of these objects scattered throughout our solar system that, together, they are the same size as a small moon, or that objects so numerous (there are billions, perhaps even trillions, of them) could be so small that all of them combined only add up to the size of a small moon. I’ll leave that one up to you guys.</p>

<p>    How Planets Form:
Despite just how vastly different they are in size and composition, terrestrial planets and gaseous ones form in a strikingly similar manner (at least we think so).
It’s understood that based on our most current model, our solar system (along with all of the other planetary systems we’ve found circling distant “Suns”) formed following the collapse of a nebular cloud. From there, it’s understood that after a newly born star emerges from its cocoon, an elliptical disk of material, called a protoplanetary disk, encircles the young star.</p>

<p>Artist rendering of a protoplanetary disk (Image Credit: Gemini Observatory/AURA Artwork by Lynette Cook)</p>

<p>The disk is composed of a variety of material, including ice, water-ice, rock, grains and some heavier elements (iron, nickel, gold, etc), but gas is by far the most prevalent type of material. Within the chaotic, spinning disks, the materials collide and start to coalesce into a planet. After enough of the materials gather, gravity takes over and helps transform the oddly shaped planetesimals into the spherical planets we all know and love.
Gas-Giants v.s. Rocky Bodies:
Of course, the concentration and the quantity of the materials dictate what the planets are made of and the number of them that form, but a different mechanism - one occurring much farther out within the disk – starts to influence the proto-planets. After hundreds of millions of years of slow accretion, all at once, they start accreting gaseous envelopes (like an atmosphere). The growth can be stanched by stellar phenomena (like solar winds), but these effects are diluted over vast distances, thus allowing the more distant planets to keep on growing until they are more gas than rock.
At such distances, the temperatures also drop off, eventually becoming so cold that even gas itself freezes over. The newly acquired mass allows the large bodies to capture the frozen gas and become even more immense, until the planets become full-blown gas-giants.

  <p>Zothecula writes Rising atmospheric CO2 levels can generally be tackled in three ways: developing alternative energy sources with lower emissions; carbon capture and storage (CCS); and capturing carbon and repurposing it. Researchers at Princeton University are claiming to have developed a technique that ticks two of these three boxes by using solar power to convert CO2 into formic acid. With power from a commercially available solar panel provided by utility company Public Service Electric and Gas (PSE&amp;G), researchers in the laboratory of Princeton professor of chemistry Andrew Bocarsly, working with researchers at New Jersey-based start-up Liquid Light Inc., converted CO2 and water to formic acid (HCOOH) in an electrochemical cell.

  <p>Yes, you read that right, NASA is launching an initiative to grow plants on the moon. This will help to answer the question, “can humans live and work on the moon long term.” I’m not talking about a few days, or even a few years, but can a human live one the lunar surface for decades. Plants are a key step in this plan.
Firstly, plants have genetic material that can be damaged in the harsh environment of space in a similar manner to humans. Watching how plants survive and reproduce over a few generations could start revealing the potential problems of long term exposure to space. The moral of the story is, if we can send plants to the moon, and the plants survive, then we probably can survive too. This will also be some of the first long term tests that study how organisms live in non-Earth gravity.
Furthermore, plants also add psychological comfort, which would be nice for the first batch of Lunar colonists. Building a plant habitat would also help us to improve on and develop technologies that allow living things to thrive in non-Earth environments. It’s important to note that this would be the first life-science experiment conducted on another world, which is incredibly exciting.
The habitat will be a self-contained module that’ll be delivered to the Lunar surface on any NASA or commercial lander. The module will contain Arabidopsis, basil, and turnips seeds. Once on the lunar surface (hopefully in late 2015), water will be added to the lunar module and an identical control on Earth. The growth of the seeds will be monitored for 10 or so days, then the data will be crunched and we’ll send follow up experiments.</p>

The Higgs boson is a cornerstone of the Standard Model, a theory developed in the early 1970s to explain the five percent of the Universe composed of visible matter and energy, all carried by fundamental particles. Now, two years after making history by unearthing the Higgs boson, the particle that confers mass, physicists are broadening their probe into its identity, hoping this will also solve other great cosmic mysteries. The better they become acquainted with the Higgs at the infinitely small quantum level, the further the experts seem from explaining certain cosmic-scale questions, like dark matter.
"The observed characteristics of the Higgs boson, such as its mass, interaction strengths and life-time, provide very powerful constraints on our understanding of the more fundamental theory," Valya Khoze, director of the Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology (IPPP) at Durham University, told AFP (PARIS).
From next year, scientists will smash sub-atomic particles at ever higher-speeds in the upgraded Large Hadron Collider (LHC) near Geneva, which announced the Higgs discovery on July 4, 2012. Not only will they hope for new particles to emerge, but also for the Higgs to show signs of, well, weirdness.So far, the Higgs has conformed well to the traits predicted in the Standard Model of particle physics, the mainstream theory of how our Universe is constructed.
The model has weaknesses in that it doesn't explain dark matter or dark energy, which jointly make up 95 percent of the Universe. Nor is it compatible with the theory of gravity. Scientists have proposed alternative theories to explain the inconsistencies -- like supersymmetry which postulates the existence of a "sibling" for every particle in the Universe and may explain dark matter and dark energy.
No proof of such symmetric particles has been found at the LHC, currently in sleep mode for an 18-month overhaul to super-boost its power levels.
Supersymmetry, additionally, predicts the existence of at least five types of Higgs boson, and physicists will thus be watching the LHC Higgs closely for signs of behaviour inconsistent with the Standard Model. "It would give us a very good hint that there is physics there beyond the Standard Model and that there's new, additional physics coming soon," said Dave Charlton, who heads the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, a facility of the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) which celebrated its 60th anniversary on Tuesday. "It could help to explain many of the other problems we have in physics at the moment," he added.
For starters, they don't understand how it [the Higgs Boson] can have such a small mass. Nor is the evidence consistent for the role it played in the development of the early Universe after the Big Bang -- issues that may be resolved by so-called New Physics the experts hope will follow soon.
When the LHC fires up again next year, scientists will be on the lookout for new particles, including other types of Higgs, and possible "invisible decays" of the boson to indicate the presence of dark matter.
"All of the particles of the Standard Model have now been discovered," said Charlton."If we see new particles, it's something new... if we see new particles, it will point to something whether it is supersymmetry or some other new theory. "It will tell us that the Standard Model is broken, that there is something else."
Charlton said we may never know if the Higgs found at the LHC was exactly the Standard Model version or something that just resembles it.
Themis Bowcock, particle physics head at the University of Liverpool, said confirmation of several Standard Model predictions over the past two years have placed a new focus on what is not yet known. "It allows us to step back and view the boundaries of our knowledge with a keener eye," he told AFP. "We realise we have mastered our closest and most obvious challenges, but like a 15th century navigator we are motivated to venture beyond our mapped lands to discover the missing 95 percent -- the New World."
In the summer of 2012, scientists hailed the announcement of the Higgs discovery, speculating that it could one day make light speed travel possible by "un-massing" objects or allow huge items to be launched into space by "switching off" the Higgs.* CERN scientist Albert de Roeck likened it to the discovery of electricity, when he said humanity could never have imagined its future applications.
"What's really important for the Higgs is that it explains how the world could be the way that it is in the first millionth of a second in the Big Bang," de Roeck told AFP.* "Can we apply it to something? At this moment my imagination is too small to do that."
Physicist Ray Volkas said "almost everybody" was hoping that, rather than fitting the so-called Standard Model of physics -- a theory explaining how particles fit together in the Universe -- the Higgs boson would prove to be "something a bit different".
"If that was the case that would point to all sorts of new physics, physics that might have something to do with dark matter," he said, referring to the hypothetical invisible matter thought to make up much of the universe.
"It could be, for example, that the Higgs particle acts as a bridge between ordinary matter, which makes up atoms, and dark matter, which we know is a very important component of the universe."
"That would have really fantastic implications for understanding all of the matter in the universe, not just ordinary atoms," he added.* De Roeck said scrutinising the new particle and determining whether it supported something other than the Standard Model would be the next step for CERN scientists.
Definitive proof that it fitted the Standard Model could take until 2015 when the LHC had more power and could harvest more data.
The LHC went offline for a two-year refit in December, 2012 that will see its firepower doubled to 14 trillion electronvolts -- a huge step forward in the search for new particles and clues about what holds them all together. De Roeck said he would find it a "little boring at the end if it turns out that this is just the Standard Model Higgs".
Instead, he was hoping it would be a "gateway or a portal to new physics, to new theories which are actually running nature" such as supersymmetry, which hypothesises that there are five different Higgs particles governing mass.
The existence of the Higgs boson was predicted in 1964 and it is named after the British physicist Peter Higgs. It is the last piece of the puzzle that has been missing from the Standard Model of physics and its function is to give other elementary particles their mass. According to the theory, the so-called Higgs field extends throughout the entire universe. The mass of individual elementary particles is determined by the extent to which they interact with the Higgs bosons.
On the one hand, the Higgs particle is the last component missing from the Standard Model of particle physics. On the other hand, physicists are struggling to understand the detected mass of the Higgs boson. "Using our theory as it currently stands, the mass of the Higgs boson can only be explained as the result of a random fine-tuning of the physical constants of the universe at a level of accuracy of one in one quadrillion," explained Matthias Neubert, of the Institute of Physics at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU).

<p>At the very heart of quantum mechanics lies a monster waiting to consume unwary minds. This monster goes by the name The Nature of Reality™. The greatest of physicists have taken one look into its mouth, saw the size of its teeth, and were consumed. Niels Bohr denied the existence of the monster after he nonchalantly (and very quietly) exited the monster’s lair muttering “shut up and calculate.” Einstein caught a glimpse of the teeth and fainted. He was reportedly rescued by Erwin Schrödinger at great personal risk, but neither really recovered from their encounter with the beast.
The upshot is that we had a group of physicists and philosophers who didn’t believe that quantum mechanics represents reality but that it was all we could see of some deeper, more fundamental theory. A subclass of these scientists believed that the randomness of quantum mechanics would eventually be explained by some non-random, deterministic property that we simply couldn’t directly observe (otherwise known as a hidden variable). Another group ended up believing that quantum mechanics did represent reality, and that, yes, reality was non-local, and possibly not very real either.
To one extent or another, these two groups are still around and still generate a fair amount of heat when they are in proximity to each other. Over the years, you would have to say that the scales have been slowly tipping in favor of the latter group. Experiments and theory have largely eliminated hidden variables. Bohm’s pilot wave, a type of hidden variable, has to be pretty extraordinary to be real.

  <p>Eating fruits and vegetables is not often thought of as a “treatment.” But according to researchers, there are more than 100 million people worldwide who have vitamin A deficiency, and for some of them, consuming fruits and vegetables is the most available treatment. That’s because people in many parts of the world do not have access to vitamin supplements. Select fruits and vegetables contain carotenoids such as beta-carotene, also known as “provitamin A.” Beta-carotene is the most potent precursor of vitamin A for humans (meaning the body breaks down beta-carotene into vitamin A).</p>

  <p>Using the National Science Foundation-supported Stampede supercomputer, Philipp Moesta and Christian D. Ott from the California Institute of Technology succeeded in performing the first 3-D simulations of a collapsing star that takes into account the influence of general relativity and magnetohydrodynamics—the interplay of electrically conducting fluids like plasmas and powerful magnetic fields. The death of these collapsing stars leads to energetic, jet-driven supernova explosions.</p>
