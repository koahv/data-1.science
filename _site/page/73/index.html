Francis One of the quietest, darkest places in the cosmos isn’t out in the depths of space. It’s at the center of a tank of cold liquid xenon in a gold mine deep under the Black Hills of South Dakota. It needs to be that quiet: any stray particles could confuse the detectors lining the outside of the tank. Those detectors are looking for faint, rare signals, ones that could reveal the presence of dark matter. The whole assembly—the container of liquid and gaseous xenon, the water tank enveloping that, and all the detectors—is called the Large Underground X...

>(Phys.org) —A team of researchers with members from the U.K., Germany and Bolivia has found evidence that suggests that parts of Bolivia now covered with rainforest were drier and more savanna-like just 2000 to 3000 years ago, a time when people were already living in the area. In their paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers describe how they took sediment core samples from lakes and noted large ditches dug by people that lived in the area during a time before the rainforests—their findings suggest such people adapted to the wetter climate over time, rather than moved into it and started cutting down trees, as has been suggested by other research....

>Down the rabbit hole in enchanting reimaginings. On July 4, 1862, English mathematician and logician Charles Dodgson boarded a small boat with a few friends. Among them was a little girl named Alice Liddell. To entertain her and her sisters as they floated down the river between Oxford and Godstow, Dodgson fancied a whimsical story, which he&#8217;d come to publish three years later under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. Alice in Wonderland went on to become one of the most beloved children&#8217;s books of all time, and my all-time favorite. In the century and a half since Sir John Tenniel&#8217;s original illustrations, the Carroll classic has sprouted everything from a pop-up book adaptation to a witty cookbook to a quantum physics allegory,...

>SolidRun A new computer called the "HummingBoard" takes on the same basic shape as the Raspberry Pi but uses a more powerful processor and supports more operating systems. SolidRun, which also makes the CuBox-i computer we wrote about, just started selling the HummingBoard in several configurations ranging from $45 to $100, not including the price of a power adapter and Micro SD card. "The HummingBoard allows you to run many open source operating systems—such as Ubuntu, Debian, and Arch—as well as Android and XBMC," SolidRun says. "With its core technology based on SolidRun’s state-of-the-art Micro System on a Module (MicroSOM), it has ready-to-use OS images, and its open hardware comes with full schematic...

I’m willing to bet that you have at least half a dozen objects in your immediate vicinity use electricity in some way to power its systems. Maybe you’re using a battery or you’re plugged directly into an outlet, but either way, this energy came to you via coal/wind/solar/geothermal or a host of other methods we use to generate power here on earth. Well, what about our spacecrafts? How do they get the power they need? It depends on where they are in the solar system. For spacecraft operating inside the inner solar system (including earth orbit), the traditional power source is solar. Solar panels (also called photovoltaics) convert light energy into us...

>The theory on animal behavior for most of history was this: people think and feel; other animals do not. It's only in recent years that there's been a sea change in the field of animal cognition, where, previously, there was almost no field at all. As The New York Times Magazine reports, animals studied in zoos seem to contain an emotional spectrum that could populate "a veritable Russian novel." Research into animal behavior is suddenly less about "Can this animal feel?" and more about "What is this animal feeling?" The answer could be a dolphin seeing itself in a mirror, an OCD brown bear, or a depressed red panda that'll break your heart. Continue reading&hellip;...

Researchers at Princeton University are claiming to have developed a technique that ticks two of these three boxes by using solar power to convert CO2 into formic acid. With power from a commercially available solar panel provided by utility company Public Service Electric and Gas (PSE&amp;G), researchers in the laboratory of Princeton professor of chemistry Andrew Bocarsly, working with researchers at New Jersey-based start-up Liquid Light Inc., converted CO2 and water to formic acid (HCOOH) in an electrochemical cell....

Watching how plants survive and reproduce over a few generations could start revealing the potential problems of long term exposure to space. The moral of the story is, if we can send plants to the moon, and the plants survive, then we probably can survive too. This will also be some of...
