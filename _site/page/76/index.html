"Suppose we have the Earth without the human population on it. Imagine two persons, one equiped with a whistle and the other equiped with a radio transmitter. One of them is in the middle of Africa and the other in the middle of the Americas. Can anybody calculate the chances that these persons will meet within their lifetime? I bet that the chances are low, very very low. Is the transmitter or the whistle of any real use for them in order to communicate over the vast distances that separate them? Not really. That's our situation in the vastness of space. Our civilization is far too young in order to be in the position to claim that there are no other intelligent lifeforms."

  <p>Warping space-time (via Anderson Institute)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the past, we have covered the feasibility of various forms of interstellar space exploration, along with a few of the proposed mechanisms that are based on technologies available to us today. Given NASA’S recent unveiling of a blueprint fora warp drive spacecraft, it is more important now than ever to put some perspective on a controversial issue and to gauge whether such a thing is actually within the realm of science fact, or if it belongs in science fiction.
Motivating Factors For Needing a Warp Drive:
To begin, the fastest current man-made object (Helios 2) would take 17 to 18 thousand years to reach our closest star, Proxima Centauri. These proposed spacecraft would reduce the journey time from millennia down to only centuries. Several generations would pass during the trip, and the ship would have to be entirely self-sufficient, recycling all food, waste and air.
But what happens when we want to go farther? If we don’t destroy ourselves, one day in the future, our descendants (man or machine) will go in search of a new planet outside the Solar System to colonize and live on. It is very unlikely that this planet will be as close to us as Proxima Centauri, so based on current technology it will still take us tens or even hundreds of thousands of years to reach these solar systems. Will future breakthroughs in science offer us a new key to alternative and faster ways to traverse space? As a result of the 100 Year Star-ship Symposium in 2012, the answer is very hopefully “yes.”
Breaking the Light-Speed Barrier:
Your initial thought – and quite rightly so – may be “surely we can’t shorten the trip too much unless we break the speed of light, and that just isn’t possible.” That statement is very true; however, we do have alternatives that are allowed by Einstein’s theories of special and general relativity. If you have watched Star Trek, you’re probably familiar with warp drive. This technology enables you to travel across vast distances of space that would otherwise take an incredibly long time to journey across using other (more conventional) means. It was always assumed these concepts were just restricted to fiction, but NASA scientists and engineers have been exploring ways in which we too can manipulate the universe and achieve faster than light travel. 
The core idea behind this travel is not the propulsion we are familiar with, but instead, this method utilizes the flexibility of the fabric of space itself. The most practical design thus far has been a ring built around a smaller craft, which would expand space rapidly behind it. A warp bubble would shift space-time around it to effectively reposition space-time without moving relative to itself. From the inside, it would appear as though you were racing through space, when in fact there would be no acceleration whatsoever!</p>

<p>Alcubierre warp drive (via Anderson Institute)</p>

<p>But the problem with this is the energy required to power it. We would need the energy-mass equivalent of a planet the size of Jupiter – which clearly isn’t feasible. But in 2012, at the 100YSS it was suggested by Harold White that we could actually achieve warp drive technology using the mass of a small car just by altering the geometry of the warp drive – quite an unbelievable mass difference. He said,
“I suddenly realized that if you made the thickness of the negative vacuum energy ring larger – like shifting from a belt shape to a donut shape – and oscillate the warp bubble, you can greatly reduce the energy required – perhaps making the idea plausible.”
[Reference: io9]
Lab work has begun on testing the theories, and they are using an interferometer to measure very small flexes in space time that they create. “We will increase the fidelity of our test devices and continue to enhance the sensitivity of the warp field interferometer – eventually using devices to directly generate negative vacuum energy.” 
White emphasizes that current work is strictly on paper and miniature experiments in the lab, but one day we could well have built a functioning warp drive. If successful laboratory tests are achieved, the possibilities of this technology incorporated in large scale projects are unbelievable. The impossible distances of space will instantaneously shrink, and human beings will have the opportunity to extend our reach not just through the solar system, but out across the galaxy (though whether that is good or bad is still up for debate)! We may well have our interstellar spaceship within an overtly optimistic 100 years.
Some Healthy Skepticism:
A few noted physicist have made it clear that the issue extends far beyond the discussions about the physics and the technology of a warp-drive engine. Sean Carroll, a theoretical cosmologist famous for his popular science books, went on record saying;</p>

<p>“The Alcubierre warp drive is a very interesting arena for thought experiments to try to better understand general relativity and quantum field theory, but it should give you zero hope for actually building a spaceship some day. Some of the many problems are discussed on Wikipedia.”
‘In short, it requires negative energy densities, which can’t be strictly disproven but are probably unrealistic; the total amount of energy is likely to be equivalent to the mass-energy of an astrophysical body; and the gravitational fields produced would likely rip any ship to shreds. My personal estimate of the likelihood we will ever be able to build a “warp drive” is much less than 1%. And the chances it will happen in the next hundred years I would put at less than 0.01%.”</p>

<p>[Reference: Jalopnik]
He, of course, also touched base on the cost of the endeavor. When referring to the research carried out by Harold White that suggests we would need far less energy for an Alcubierre Drive than originally expected, he said;</p>

<p>‘”… note that “the mass-energy equivalent” of 700 kg (which I don’t believe for a second, I suspect you need much more) essentially means you need 350 kg of antimatter to combine with 350 kg of matter (from here). They note that the current cost of producing 1 gram of antimatter is about $100 trillion. But, with completely unsupported optimistic estimates, you might get that down to $10 billion per gram. So, with the most wild-eyed pie-in-the-sky estimates, fuel alone will cost you $3.5 quadrillion — roughly the entire economic output of the world for forty years. Good luck with the Kickstarter!”</p>

The first images taken by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) after the survey began in August 2013 have revealed a rare, 'superluminous' supernova that erupted in a galaxy 7.8 billion light years away. The stellar explosion, called DES13S2cmm, easily outshines most galaxies in the Universe and could still be seen in the data six months later, at the end of the first of what will be five years of observing by DES. The event was discovered by Andreas Papadopoulos, a postgraduate student from the University of Portsmouth, who will present the discovery at the National Astronomy Meeting 2014 in Portsmouth today, Wednesday, 25 June.
Superluminous supernovae are a recent discovery, only being recognized as a distinct class of objects in the past 5 years. These cosmic explosions are 10-50 times brighter at their peak than the brightest normal type of supernovae and, unlike other supernovae, their explosive origins remain a mystery.
"Fewer than forty such supernovae have ever been found and I never expected to find one in the first DES images!" said Papadopoulos. "As they are rare, each new discovery brings the potential for greater understanding -- or more surprises."It turns out that even within this select group, DES13S2cmm is unusual. The rate that it is fading away over time is much slower than for most other superluminous supernovae that have been observed to date. This change in brightness over time, or 'light curve', gives information on the mechanisms that caused the explosion and the composition of the material ejected.
Dr Mark Sullivan of Southampton University led the program to obtain spectroscopy of DES13S2cmm using the Very Large Telescope at Cerro Paranal, Chile. "Its unusual, slow decline was not apparent at first," said Sullivan, "but as more data came in and the supernova stopped getting fainter, we would look at the light curve and ask ourselves, 'what is this?'"Understanding the origins of DES13S2cmm is proving difficult. Radioactive decay is known to power normal supernovae, but not from such extreme amounts of material.
"We have tried to explain the supernova as a result of the decay of the radioactive isotope Nickel-56," explained Dr Chris D'Andrea of the University of Portsmouth, co-author on the research, "but to match the peak brightness, the explosion would need to produce more than three times the mass of our Sun of the element. And even then the behaviour of the light curve doesn't match up."
The team are now investigating alternative explanations, including that DES13S2cmm is a normal supernova that has created at its core a magnetar -- an exotic neutron star spinning hundreds of times per second, producing a magnetic field a trillion times stronger than that on Earth. Energy from the magnetar is then injected into the supernova, making the explosion exceptionally bright. "Neither model is a particularly compelling match to the data," noted D'Andrea.With DES starting its second season in August, the hunt is on for more superluminous supernovae.
"With so few known, it's hard to really understand their properties in detail," said Prof Bob Nichol of the University of Portsmouth. "DES should find enough of these objects to allow us to understand superluminous supernovae as a population. But if some of these discoveries prove as difficult to interpret as DES13S2cmm, we're prepared for the unusual!"
The image at the top of the page shows superluminous supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years after the Big Bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the Sun.

  <p>(Phys.org) —Scientists have developed a promising nanomaterial that may be adaptable for use in a wide range of applications. An international team headed by scientists from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) and the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces in Potsdam-Golm has developed an elegant method for producing self-organised carbon nanolayers and equipping them chemically with a range of functions. Such functionalised carbon nanolayers are believed to be suitable for various applications. For example, they could act as coatings that make surfaces both scratchproof and dirt-repellent, or as sensors for the detection of extremely small amounts of substances. The electrical conductivity of carbon layers also makes them suitable for use as electronic components in various applications.</p>

  <p>“Presence is far more intricate and rewarding an art than productivity.”
In the fall of 2013, as Brain Pickings was turning seven, I wrote about the seven most important things I learned in those seven years of reading, writing, and living. Much to my surprise and humbling delight, I began receiving a steady outpour of letters from readers, people for whom these notes to myself had struck a deep chord of resonance in their own lives, on their own journeys.
Eventually, my friends at Holstee — makers of the beloved Holstee Manifesto — reached out and suggested a creative collaboration that would bring these seven learnings to life in visual form. Having known the Holstee crew for many years, and having long shared an enormous kinship of spirit and values with them, I was instantly in. We worked with Uruguayan illustrator and graphic designer Martin Azambuja, who came up with the visual metaphor of a mobile for an added layer of symbolism.
I’m proud and so very excited to reveal the end result of this collaborative labor of love, months in the making — an 18″x24″ letterpress poster printed on thick, sustainable cotton paper, inspired by vintage children’s book illustration and mid-century graphic design.</p>

<p>In today’s segment of FQtQ’s “APotD,” we explore a distant celestial region that is located more than 5,500 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Scorpius.
This particular region, known as NGC 6334 (more casually known as the Cat’s Paw Nebula), is seen in false-color. The greenish hues represent the IRAC 8 micron data, while the blue represents data collected using  NOAO ‘s ‘Extremely Wide-Field Infrared Imager‘ [NEWFIRM]. The red is representative of the data collected of the region at far-infrared wavelengths by the Herschel Space Telescope.
As you can deduce, the interstellar medium surrounding NGC 6334 is quite busy (not to mention large; it spans over an area roughly 70 light-years across). Because of the influx of  on-going star formation activity, this area is classified as a ‘starburst region.’ Current estimates say that the material found within the region is generating a whole host of stars, with all of them weighing in at a combined 3,600 solar masses.

The team studied saccadic eye movements – those movements where the eye jumps from one point of focus to another – in an effort to determine exactly how this happens without us being overcome by our brains processing too much visual information.</p>

  <p>(Phys.org) —Trillions of bacteria live in and on the human body; a few species can make us sick, but many others keep us healthy by boosting digestion and preventing inflammation. Although there’s plenty of evidence that these microbes play a collective role in human health, we still know very little about most of the individual bacterial species that make up these communities. Employing the use of a specially designed glass chip with tiny compartments, Caltech researchers now provide a way to target and grow specific microbes from the human gut—a key step in understanding which bacteria are helpful to human health and which are harmful.</p>
