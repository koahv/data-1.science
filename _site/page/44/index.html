  <p>Today is already a good day, you can now add CRYENGINE to the official list of game engines that support Linux, so here’s to hoping more games can come over.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means games like Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Evolve, Crysis (I can dream!) and many more can easily come over to Linux. It’s still probably not a click of a button, but it means developers have far less work to do.</p>

<p>QuoteNew API: OpenGL Support
Starting with 3.8.1, we are shipping a fully-featured OpenGL rendering implementation with CRYENGINE, which goes hand in hand with Linux support for your games (see below).</p>

<p>New platform: Linux
As previously announced, we are adding Linux support for your Game.exe. While you will still need Windows to use the Sandbox Editor, you can now release your commercial games on Linux as well as on PC- and of course, there are still no royalties whatsoever!</p>

<p>See their full announcement here.</p>

<p>It’s doubtful we will see any older games coming over, that is unless developers really care about their older games. It’s a shame, as we do need a back catalogue of older games, and not just newer games. If Crytek ported their Crysis games over to Linux, that would be a great showcase for their engine, but I extremely doubt they would.</p>

  <p>Follow @LinuxUserMag
AWS, short for Amazon Web Services, is the equivalent of an online retailer for virtual infrastructure and cloud services, complete with an automated self-service checkout and rock-bottom prices. Amazon’s pay-as-you-go rendition of enterprise-class infrastructure services is welcomed by cost- conscious, performance-hungry users – from website owners who need to scale out on demand, to software developers and Linux administrators who only need a Linux box for a few hours. On AWS, there are no long-term commitments – you only pay for actual use.
With cost savings of as much as 72 per cent and more over a conventional data centre, it is no wonder that AWS quickly became the hot ticket in town. The research firm Gartner estimates the total global market share of AWS at a mind-bending 83 per cent. Arguably, the most important feature of Amazon’s cloud is not its sheer size but its affordability.
Amazon gives each new account owner a Free Usage Tier for a full year after they first register: https://aws.amazon.com/free.
So, thanks to its low prices, no up-front investment, its granular administrative controls and the freedom to run your own infrastructure in your own way, AWS has turned into an open source stronghold where Linux reigns supreme.
￼If you want to run your own Linux box in the cloud, look no further than EC2
Resources
Web browser
Phone number
Email address
Credit card number
SSH client (optional)
Step-by-step
Step 01 Create a new AWS root account
To get started with AWS, navigate to it in a web browser and click on ‘Create a Free Account’. At this point you could sign in with your existing Amazon credentials but this isn’t always a good idea. Should you ever need to terminate your AWS account, you would also lose access to your account with Amazon, the online retailer. For this reason, most users prefer to register with another email address just to be safe, in case anything happens in the future.
Step 02 Complete the registration process
During registration, AWS will ask you to provide your contact details including an email address, your phone number and a credit card number. Amazon will then verify that you are human via an automated phone call. Your credit card number serves to confirm your identity as the payer and Amazon will keep it on file. As long as you only use services that are within your Free Tier capacity allotment, your card will not be charged at any point.
The registration process creates an AWS root account, which grants you access to all AWS infrastructure services. It has nothing to do with a root account on a Linux system, even though the underlying concept is very similar.
Never use your AWS root credentials for administrative work on your account except during your initial sign-in in the next step.
Step 03 Sign in to your AWS root account
The browser-based administrative interface on Amazon – the AWS Management Console – is the main switchboard for your AWS infrastructure and services. You can access it at the AWS site from the pull-down menu called My Account or directly as well. In either case, use the credentials of your AWS root account (your email address and your AWS root password). Make sure you never do this on a public network or public computer because if your credentials were intercepted, you could lose access to your entire infrastructure while still footing the bill. For this reason, Amazon recommends that after the initial sign-in, you immediately create a less privileged IAM user for your daily interactions with AWS and link it to an MFA device for multifactor authentication
(which is a topic for another tutorial altogether).
Step 04 Navigate the AWS Management Console
Quite predictably, the Console is peppered with AWS lingo so pervasive that even the toughest occasionally shake their heads in disbelief. To fire up a Linux box in the AWS cloud, you want to navigate to EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud). For DNS services and domain name registration, head towards Route 53. If all you need is some storage that should remain easily accessible, you don’t actually need a Linux box – instead, go straight to the S3 (Simple Storage Service) section of the Console. The simplest way to get to your destination is by using the AWS logo in the upper left-hand corner of the Console, as this gives you access to the list of available services.
Step 05 Choose your AWS region
Some AWS services, particularly EC2, require you to select an AWS region. A region is a set of interconnected data centres, called AWS zones, with a common tax jurisdiction and identical pricing. You can utilise services in any of the nine AWS regions, not just your default one, and combine them to suit you. Typically, you would pick the most cost-effective one or combine several regions that are closest to the location of your end users to minimise latency. It’s important to remember that your EC2 dashboard shows infrastructure that you are paying for only in the region currently selected. This is a common trick of AWS: watching resource consumption in the dashboard of a wrong region, so beware.
Step 06 Launch a new EC2 instance
Navigate to the EC2 section of the AWS Management Console. This part of the interface grants you access to a variety of infrastructure services which enable you to build and run your own Linux box in the AWS cloud, a so-called EC2 instance of Linux.
Each EC2 instance represents a host that runs in a virtualised environment in isolation from other virtual machines, which makes it very cost-effective and reasonably safe. In order to start your own Linux server in the cloud, click on Launch Instance in the EC2 Dashboard. You can also click on the link Instance in the left- hand navigation pane of the AWS Management Console and then on the button Launch Instance.
Step 07 Select a Linux-based AMI
The storage configuration of an instance is described using a machine definition called an AMI (Amazon Machine Image). An AMI specifies, among other things, the contents of the boot volume. Select an AMI based on a Linux distribution of your choice from the list in section Quick Start (not a database instance, an Amazon RDS instance doesn’t grant you superuser access at the OS level). Instances labelled ‘Free tier eligible’ do not incur any costs so long as you remain within the time allotment of up to 720 hours per month throughout the first 12 months after your account is first registered.
Step 08 Choose an instance type
The instance type defines the performance characteristics of your Linux box in terms of its clock speed, available RAM, internal storage and network capabilities. The only instance type that qualifies for the free usage tier is t2.micro.
Make your choice and then click ‘Next: Configure Instance Details’.
Step 09 Configure instance details
On the next screen, you can select how many instances to start, whether you want them to be persistent (leave the Purchasing option check box deactivated), if they should have their own privileges to access your AWS services (IAM role&gt;None), and configure networking. It is best to launch an EC2 instance n a virtual private cloud (VPC), which is a fancy way of saying that Amazon will isolate it from other users’ instances by means of smart routing. Older AWS accounts may also offer an option labelled ‘EC2-Classic’, which does not have this protection, so if you see it, don’t use it.
In the menu ‘Auto-assign Public IP’, select ‘Use subnet setting (Disable)’. Set the IAM role to None and shutdown behaviour to Stop.
If you enable ‘Termination protection’, AWS won’t let you destroy the instance using the Terminate command in the Console until you remove this protection.
Leave the other options unchanged and click on ‘Next: Add Storage’.
Step 10 Attach storage
If you need additional volumes, you can create and attach them now. Free Tier covers up to 30GB of General Purpose (SSD) storage giving you a maximum baseline performance of slightly under 100 IOPS (see ‘EBS Volumes’ boxout for more information).
Now click on ‘Next: Tag Instance’.
Step 11 Tag your Linux Instance
Tags on AWS are key value pairs that store information that can help you to organise your AWS resources. Using tags is purely optional. Don’t sweat it – you can always edit tags later if you need to. If nothing comes to mind, click on Next&gt;Configure Security Groups.
Step 12 Configure security groups
Think of Security Groups as settings for an AWS firewall that specify ‘Enable rules for inbound and outbound traffic’. For each Linux instance, you need to enable ingress access (inbound traffic) on TCP port 22 for SSH from at least one IP address (yours). Unless you are on a static IP (or an IP range), you may have to enable access from anywhere. If you need other services, add the corresponding rules (eg open port 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS if you want to run a web server). Then click on ‘Review and Launch’.
Step ￼￼13 Create or select a key pair
Verify your settings and hit Launch. The wizard will ask you to create or select a key.
Passwords are out, key pairs are in. A private key is what authenticates you as the administrator of your Linux instance. SSH will attempt to verify the authenticity of your private key, based on a copy of a corresponding public key that AWS is about to save in the appropriate location of the Linux system on your instance.
You could generate your key pair yourself and upload the public key to the EC2 console, or you can ask Amazon to create a key pair for you, which is faster. Select ‘Create a new key pair’, give it a name, download the private key to your computer and correct access privileges on it:
chmod 400 /path/to/yourPrivateKey.pem
Once this is done, you can launch your instance. It will show up in the section Instances of the AWS Management Console for EC2.
Step 14 Assign an EIP to your EC2 instance
Unless you chose to auto-assign a public IP to your instance, it does not have a Public DNS entry yet and is inaccessible from the outside. Click on the link Elastic IPs in the left-hand navigation pane of the EC2 console. Here you need to obtain a new elastic IP address for your AWS account (Allocate New Address) and associate it with your instance (Associate Address).
Step 15 Connect to your Linux instance
Wait until your instance passes both health checks and reports its state as ‘running’. Now you should be able to connect to it using any stand-alone SSH client or the Java-based client that Amazon provides. Navigate to the Instances section of the Console, select your instance from the list and click on the Connect button to view instructions. Start an SSH client and enter something like this:
ssh -i /path/to/yourPrivateKey.pem username@XX.XX.XXX.XX
The username is usually either ec2user or root, but technically the creator of the AMI can set it to whatever they want. If your initial username is anything other than root, you can assume superuser privileges using the command:
sudo su
If you attached any additional volumes to your instance (besides the volumes that came with the AMI), now is the time to format them, mount them and add them to /etc/fstab.

Since galaxies are believed to have co-evolved with SMBHs, SMBH mass is an important parameter in understanding their relation in the context of galaxy evolution.

Above: In 1988, GE flew  to the Farnborough Air Show a plane powered by the GE36 unducted turbofan engine with composite blades. The engine didn’t take off, but the technology did.

<p>The result was the GE90, the world’s largest and most powerful jet engine, and the bet, which took place 20 years ago, keeps paying off.  “It was an investment that wasn’t just for the GE90,“ Joyce said at the Paris Air Show this week.
Nick Kray, consulting engineer for composite design at GE Aviation, helped develop the GE90 fan blade.Two giant GE90s in one shot: The first application of the blade technology was the GE90 engine built for Boeing 777. The engine was certified 20 years ago and GE is still building it for brand new 777 planes, like this China Airlines jet at the Paris Air Show. Image credit: Adam Senatori</p>

<p>GE’s next engine, the GEnx, used composites for fan blades but also for the fan casing, a new application of the material that helped the engine shed hundreds of pounds.The latest engines like the LEAP and the GE9X and also standing on the shoulders of the GE90 giant, and adding the newest materials and technologies such as heat-resistant ceramic matrix composites and 3D printing. “We have a really nice suite of technologies to sample,” Joyce said.The next engine with composites blades and also other parts was the GEnx. Here it’s powering the Vietnam Airlines Dreamliner over Paris during a routine that has since become a YouTube sensation. Image credit: GE Reports/Adam Senatori</p>

<p>But GE Aviation is not the only business with access to this high-tech buffet. For example, aircraft engine technologies have found applications in gas turbines for power generation and wind turbine design. “We all share and leverage what scientists at our Global Research Centers develop,” Joyce said. “That’s the idea of the ‘GE store.’” See our list below:The fan of the LEAP jet engine designed by CFM International, a 50/50 joint company set up by GE Aviation and France’s Safran (Snecma), is using woven carbon fiber blades developed by Snecma. Image credit: GE Reports/Adam SenatoriLEAP engines will also have for the first time 3D-printed fuel nozzles (the round part above) and parts made from a breakthrough material called ceramic matrix composites (CMCs). CMCs are both heat resistant and weigh much less than metal. Image credit: GE Reports/Adam SenatoriBut GE is not finished. The company is now developing the world’s largest engine, the GE9X for Boeing’s new 777X plane. It will include fourth generation fan blades, CMCs and 3D printed components. The engine was designed to use 10 percent less fuel than the world’s most powerful engine, the GE-115B. (GE Aviation’s Rick Kennedy in the video above has the details.)For the first time in civilian aviation, GE is testing blades made from CMCs that could be used inside the GE9X. In the future, these blades, which GE unveiled at the Paris Air Show, could be also used to retrofit existing engines like the GEnx. CMCs are one third the weight of metal but withstand higher temperatures. This combination leads to lighter and more efficient jet engines. Image credit: GE Reports/Adam SenatoriGE started testing fourth-generation carbon fiber composite blades for the GE9X. The blades are thinner, wider and longer than ever before. (The video below has more on the testing process.)GE is also testing the GE9X engine’s new core in Massa, Italy.</p>

  <p>So perhaps there is some truth in the old legends of the underworld reeking of brimstone (or sulphur, as it is now called)? New research confirms that the Earth’s core does in fact contain vast amounts of sulphur, estimated to be up to 8.5 x 1018 tonnes. This is about 10 times the amount of sulphur in the rest of the Earth, based on the most recent estimates (and for comparison, around 10% of the total mass of the Moon). This is the first time that scientists have conclusive geochemical evidence for sulphur in the Earth’s core, lending weight to the theory that the Moon was formed by a planet-sized body colliding with the Earth. This work is reported in the peer-reviewed journal, Geochemical Perspectives Letters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The thought of alien worlds conjures up images from popular science fiction—the desert world of Tatooine from Star Wars, the surreal forests of Pandora from Avatar—but exoplanets aren’t sci-fi anymore. As scientists discover and classify new planets, one cannot help but wonder, what are these distant worlds really like?
As it turns out, even the most imaginative book or film does little justice to real exoplanets; From planets with diamond cores, to worlds that hang between extremes, the beauty and diversity of exoplanets is both humbling and remarkable. The planets listed below are probably just the tip of the iceberg..
Carbon Planets:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What are they?
Carbon planets are composed almost entirely of carbon compounds, rather than the silicate-rich rocky planets in our solar system. Scientists believe their chemistry could create some very bizarre surface features, including lakes and oceans of tar or other hydrocarbons—not unlike the hydrocarbon lakes of Titan. Some could even have graphite crusts several kilometers thick.
(Image Credit: Luyten, via Wikimedia Commons.)
Similarly, some carbon planets may have mantles or cores of solid diamond. While it sounds unbelievable, remember: diamonds are really just carbon compounds that form under extreme heat and pressures (like deep within Earth), so it’s actually logical that a carbon-rich planet could have a layer of diamond hiding deep under its surface.
Have we found one?
Yes, we think so! The planet 55 Cancri E is likely a carbon planet, and WASP-12b may be as well.
Could carbon planets harbor life?
Not as we know it. Carbon planets probably lack substantial water, making Earth-like life impossible. It’s conceivable that alien organisms could evolve without water altogether though, but scientists aren’t sure how their biology or metabolic processes would work.
But here’s a fun thought experiment on the diamond front: Since diamonds would be abundant on these planets, they’d probably be worth about as much as a pile of rocks on Earth. Intelligent aliens—if they somehow managed to evolve on a diamond-rich carbon planet—could potentially use diamonds in the same way humans once used stone tools; One could even imagine an alien “diamond age” akin to the human “stone age.”   Pretty wild, right?
Water Worlds:</p>

<p>What are they?
As the name suggests, the surfaces of water worlds are completely covered, some possibly hundreds or thousands of miles deep, with water in liquid form. If conditions are right, the extreme pressure near the bottom of these oceans could squeeze liquid water into ice—even at temperatures above freezing.

Conversely, some with planet-wide seas could completely freeze over, and become planetary “snowballs.” Interestingly, scientists believe Earth may have experienced something similar around 700 million years ago. This catastrophic period—aptly called “Snowball Earth”—may have caused glaciers to extend to the equator, completely covering our planet’s surface in ice.
Have we found one?
NASA has found several water world candidates, including Kepler-62e and Kepler-62f. Both planets are in their respective Goldilocks zones—the area around a star that is conducive for liquid water to thrive—and computer models suggest that both are mostly or completely covered in water.
Kepler-62f could wind up being an ice planet if it lacks an atmosphere that traps heat (like a greenhouse effect). It may even resemble Jupiter’s moon Europa, which is also covered in ice, but likely hides a massive subsurface ocean.

Could water planets harbor life?
Yes, absolutely! Scientists believe some ocean planets could be teeming with aquatic life similar to the kind in Earth’s oceans.
The habitability of ice-covered planets is less clear, but NASA is so confident that they could, they plan to send a probe to Europa to search for signs of life beneath its thick layers of ice. It’s believed sub-glacial oceans may even stay warm through tidal or geologic activity, making some hospitable to microbial organisms, perhaps even complex life
Chthonian Planets:</p>

<p>What are they?
A Chthonian planet (pronounced “kuh-tho-nee-an”) is the remnant of a hot-Jupiter exoplanet that has had its atmosphere stripped away through stellar winds—which are intense considering the close proximity of the planet to its parent star—leaving only a rocky core behind.
An artist’s conception of a chthonian planet orbiting close to its parent star. (Image credit: ESO, via Wikimedia Commons)
Interestingly, the name “chthonian” in this context comes from the Greek word “khthonios,” referring to Greek mythological spirits of the underworld. It’s certainly a fitting name, given the fact that surface temperatures on these planets can rise to a hellish 4000 F (2200 C).
Have we found one?
We think so! The planet CoRoT-7b is believed to be a chthonian planet. Another, dubbed HD 209458b, is currently losing mass and will likely become one in the future.
Could chthonian planets harbor life?
No way.  Their surfaces can get hot enough to vaporize lead.
Eccentric Planets:</p>

<p>What are they?
Eccentric planets have highly elliptical orbits similar to that of comets. They periodically pass very close to their parent star, only to drift far away before looping back for another close pass. This ongoing cycle causes eccentric planets to have dramatic changes in seasons. Temperatures can vary from as cold as Pluto, to as hot as the surface of its parent star—all within a single “year.”

Have we found one?
Eccentric planets are actually fairly common. Many have orbits as elliptical as the orbits of some comets in our solar system. Some, like HD 80606 b, are more eccentric.
Could eccentric planets harbor life?
Possibly, but lifeforms would have to be incredibly resilient and adaptable for long term survival. Say one eccentric planet goes through a mild period, followed by long, extreme winters, evolution could eventually see organisms arise with the ability to slow their metabolisms or hibernate during colder periods.  If its surface periodically gets super-hot, life might be able to survive deep underground.
Rogue Planets:</p>

<p>(a.k.a. “Free-Floating” or “Interstellar” Planets)
What are they?
Rogue planets are lone wanderers that float freely through space, unbound to any star. Despite being nearly undetectable by modern telescopes, scientists believe rogue planets outnumber stars in the Milky Way by a factor of at least 2 to 1 (upper estimates place that number at 100,000 to 1).
As of now, scientists aren’t even sure how rogue planets form, though some were likely ejected from planetary systems long ago.
Have we found one?
Yes, we have! PSO J318.5-22, a planet about 6 heavier than  Jupiter, is believed to be one.  Others have either been spotted or inferred through other means.

Could rogue planets harbor life?
This is a tough question. Since rogues don’t orbit stars, they would be perpetually dark, with no outside source of heat or energy. Any heat would need to come from the planet itself, either from geologic activity, or through tidal forces from moons that were retained.
Without light, an alien biosphere couldn’t rely on photosynthesis. However, life could potentially utilize geologic activity for energy, much like the organisms that live around hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor.  All in all, there’s no way to know until we study a rogue planet up close (and that’s unlikely).
