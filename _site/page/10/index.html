>The transition to land from our fishy ancestors is one of the most iconic, and best documented, transitions in the fossil record. We know that fleshy-limbed fish living in shallows used their limbs to move in the shallows and then up onto land, and became tetrapods (4-legged vertebrates) along the way. What has been less well-studied is the transition to vision in air that also occurred during that evolutionary event. Vision in air is different, and in some ways easier, than seeing in water. According to a new study by Malcolm MacIver of Northwestern University and Lars Schmitz of the Claremont Colleges, early tetrapod ancestors may have been seeing like land-based animals before they were moving like them....

>With the high environmental cost of conventional energy sources and the finite supply of fossil fuels, the importance of renewable energy sources has become much more apparent in recent years. However, efficiently harnessing solar energy for human use has been a difficult task. While silicon-based solar cells can be used to capture sunlight energy, they are costly to produce on an industrial scale. Research from the Energy Materials and Surface Sciences Unit at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), led by Prof. Yabing Qi, has focused on using organo-metal halide perovskite films in solar cells. These perovskite films are highly crystalline materials that can be formed by a large number of different chem...
