  <p>A well-known songbird, the great tit, has revealed its genetic code, offering researchers new insight into how species adapt to a changing planet. Their initial findings suggest that epigenetics – what’s on rather than what’s in the gene – may play a key role in the evolution of memory and learning. And that’s not just true for birds.</p>

  <p>(University of Bonn) To date, research on the effects of climate change has underestimated the contribution of seawater expansion to sea level rise due to warming of the oceans. A team of researchers at the University of Bonn has now investigated, using satellite data, that this effect was almost twice as large over the past twelve years than previously assumed. That may result in, for example, significantly increased risks of storm surges. The scientists are presenting their findings in the renowned scientific journal ‘PNAS’.</p>

  <p>(Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute) For the first time, researchers at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute have been able to directly estimate the Anglo-Saxon ancestry of the British population, using ancient skeletons. Human remains excavated from burial sites near Cambridge provided the material for the first whole-genome sequences of ancient British DNA. The study estimated that approximately a third of British ancestors were Anglo-Saxon immigrants, showing how Anglo-Saxon immigrants mixed with the native population.</p>

  <p>Stars like the Sun begin their lives as cold, dense cores of dust and gas that collapse under the influence of gravity until nuclear fusion is ignited. These cores contain hundreds to thousands of solar-masses of material and have gas densities about a thousand times greater than typical interstellar regions (the typical value is about one molecule per cubic centimeter). How the collapse process occurs in these embryos in poorly understood, from the number of stars that form to the factors that determine their ultimate masses, as well as the detailed timescale for stellar birth. Material, for example, might simply fall freely to the center of the core, but in most realistic scenarios the infall is inhibited by pressure from warm gas, turbulent motions, magnetic fields, or some combination of them.</p>

  <p>Over the past 25 years, scientists have supported the view that modern humans left Africa around 50,000 years ago, spreading to different parts of the world by replacing resident human species like the Neanderthals.

  <p>In “Star Trek,” a transporter can teleport a person from one location to a remote location without actually making the journey along the way. Such a transporter has fascinated many people. Quantum teleportation shares several features of the transporter and is one of the most important protocols in quantum information. In a recent study, Prof. Tongcang Li at Purdue University and Dr. Zhang-qi Yin at Tsinghua University proposed the first scheme to use electromechanical oscillators and superconducting circuits to teleport the internal quantum state (memory) and center-of-mass motion state of a microorganism. They also proposed a scheme to create a Schrödinger’s cat state in which a microorganism can be in two places at the same time. This is an important step toward potentially teleporting an organism in future.</p>

  <p>(Phys.org)—In many ways, water behaves very differently than other liquids do, and with important consequences: It’s widely thought that water’s unusual properties were essential for the development of life on Earth. One prime example is the fact that ice floats. Unlike other substances, frozen water is less dense than liquid water, and this anomaly allows fish and other aquatic lifeforms to survive in the water under a frozen layer of protective ice during cold periods. Water also has a high heat capacity, meaning it can absorb and release a large amount of heat while undergoing very little change in temperature. This property helps many living organisms maintain a relatively stable body temperature, and it also provides a pleasant climate in Europe due to the warm Gulf Stream current.</p>

  <p>(University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus) A University of Colorado Cancer Center paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that the evolutionary force of genetic drift contributes to the ability of cancerous cells to overtake populations of healthy cells in young children. In contrast, genetic drift contributes almost not at all to leukemia formation in adults. The finding suggests important new avenues for leukemia treatment in very young patients.</p>

  <p>The United States has 50,000 spinning wind turbines on its lands. Wind power is a critical solution to CO2 emissions and air and water pollution from power plants, and these 50,000 wind turbines result in steep emissions cuts Though, Climate Central notes “how uneven the decline in those emissions” was across the US in recent years.

  <p>(University of Chicago Medical Center) A single chance mutation caused an ancient protein to evolve a new function essential for multicellularity in animals, about a billion years ago, according to research co-led by UChicago scientists. By conducting experiments on ‘resurrected’ ancestral proteins, the researchers shed light on the origin of a molecular process that allows animals to form and maintain organized tissues. The study is the first to experimentally describe a molecular mechanism involved in the evolution of multicellularity.</p>

  <p>(Cell Press) When modern humans met Neanderthals in Europe and the two species began interbreeding many thousands of years ago, the exchange left humans with gene variations that have increased the ability of those who carry them to ward off infection. This inheritance from Neanderthals may have also left some people more prone to allergies.</p>

  <p>Researchers of the ITC Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation of the University of Twente have developed a unique map of all 250 African bat species on a high-resolution scale (1 km2). There are very few examples of biodiversity richness based on quantitative data at a continental scale, especially for challenging guilds like bats. The findings of the research are presented in the January edition of the scientific journal Ecological Modelling.</p>

  <p>Scientists from the Senckenberg Center for Human Evolution and Palaeoenvironment in Tübingen and from the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt examined the demise of the giant ape Gigantopithecus. In their study, published recently in the scientific journal Quaternary International, they reach the conclusion that the presumably largest apes in geological history died due to their insufficient adaptability. Analyses of fossil tooth enamel show that the primates were restricted to forested habitats.</p>

  <p>(University of Sydney) An international group of astronomers led by the University of Sydney has discovered strong magnetic fields are common in stars, not rare as previously thought, which will dramatically impact our understanding of how stars evolve and potentially lead to a better understanding of the sun’s 22-year magnetic cycle – known to affect communication systems and cloud cover on Earth.</p>

  <p>Gravity is a fundamental force of physics, one which we Earthlings tend to take for granted. You can’t really blame us. Having evolved over the course of billions of years in Earth’s environment, we are used to living with the pull of a steady 1 g (or 9.8 m/s2). However, for those who have gone into space or set foot on the Moon, gravity is a very tenuous and precious thing.</p>

  <p>(Hiroshima University) Researchers in Japan and China identified the requirements for the development of new types of extremely low power consumption electric devices by studying thin films made of Cr-doped (Sb, Bi)2Te3. At extremely low temperatures, an electric current flows around the edge of the film without energy loss owing to ferromagnetism. The research group proved that the atoms of non-magnetic elements such as Sb atoms and Te atoms are key to the material’s ferromagnetism.</p>

  <p>(NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center) Inside NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center’s massive clean room in Greenbelt, Maryland, the ninth flight mirror was installed onto the telescope structure with a robotic arm. This marks the halfway completion point for the James Webb Space Telescope’s segmented primary mirror.</p>

  <p>The diversity of mammals on Earth exploded straight after the dinosaur extinction event, according to UCL researchers. New analysis of the fossil record shows that placental mammals, the group that today includes nearly 5000 species including humans, became more varied in anatomy during the Paleocene epoch - the 10 million years immediately following the event.</p>
