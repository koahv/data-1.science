Our eyes that scan the farthest reaches of the universe had their origin in water, in the simple hydra, a members ancient group of sea creatures that along with jellyfish, belong to the phylum cnidaria that first emerged 600 million years ago and are still flourishing.
“We determined which genetic ‘gateway,’ or ion channel, in the hydra is involved in light sensitivity,” said Todd H. Oakley, assistant professor in UCSB’s Department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology author of a 2010 UC Santa Barbara study. “This is the same gateway that is used in human vision.”
Oakley explained that there are many genes involved in vision, and that there is an ion channel gene responsible for starting the neural impulse of vision. This gene controls the entrance and exit of ions; i.e., it acts as a gateway. The gene, called opsin, is present in vision among vertebrate animals, and is responsible for a different way of seeing than that of animals like flies. The vision of insects emerged later than the visual machinery found in hydra and vertebrate animals.
The research challenged the misunderstanding that evolution represents a ladder-like march of progress, with humans at the pinnacle. “Instead, it illustrates how all organisms – humans included – are a complex mix of ancient and new characteristics, said Oakley.”
Fast forward to today: zoologists from Cologne and Lyon announced that they have succeeded in reconstructing the structure of the eye of a predatory crustacean from the time of the dinosaurs –the internal structure of an approximately 160 million year old compound eye (sown below Dollocaris ingens van Straelen, 1923, Thylacocephala) from the Middle Jurassic period. It was discovered at the La Voulte deposit in southeastern France.
 </p>

<p>The eyes of this crustacean consist of approximately 18,000 facets, and because each of these facets contributes to the entire image as pixels contribute to a computer graphic, the eye of this crustacean belongs to the most accurate in the arthropod realm.
With the reconstruction of the eye’s structure, the scientists succeeded in making the structure of soft tissue visible – which was long considered to be impossible. Together with the palaeontologist Jean Vannier and other colleagues, the zoologist Brigitte Schoenemann from the University of Cologne played a leading role in this research.
The construction of the crustacean’s high-performance eye most closely resembles that of a bee or a dragonfly. Most likely it also functioned in a similar way. A physical analysis revealed that this crustacean was active during the day and lived in the light-flooded parts of the ocean. An analysis of its stomach showed that it obviously chased smaller sea organisms and fed on them.
This research work is important because up to now researchers thought that only the hard parts of an animal, such as shells or bones, could be preserved. Hence the findings of the research team on soft tissue are ground-breaking – and they describe fossil sensory cells older than those preserved in the relatively young amber.
Recently, computer-tomography has revealed that even individual sensory cells can be documented. The recent research work shows for the first time that the complete structure of a compound eye can be analysed and resolved. The team was able to open up completely new perspectives – not just for the investigation of fossilised sensory systems. It also showed that in contrast to earlier opinions, the fossil record can contribute important facts to the discussion of the evolution of visual and other internal systems.

Most galaxies possess a majestic spiral or elliptical structure. About a quarter of galaxies, though, defy such conventional, rounded aesthetics, instead sporting a messy, indefinable shape. Known as irregular galaxies, this group includes NGC 5408, the galaxy that has been snapped here by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope.
John Herschel recorded the existence of NGC 5408 in June 1834. Astronomers had long mistaken NGC 5408 for a planetary nebula, an expelled cloud of material from an aging star. Instead, bucking labels, NGC 5408 turned out to be an entire galaxy, located about 16 million light-years from Earth in the constellation of Centaurus (The Centaur).
In yet another sign of NGC 5408 breaking convention, the galaxy is associated with an object known as an ultraluminous X-ray source, dubbed NGC 5408 X-1, one of the best studied of its class. These rare objects beam out prodigious amounts of energetic X-rays. Astrophysicists believe these sources to be strong candidates for intermediate-mass black holes. This hypothetical type of black hole has significantly less mass than the supermassive black holes found in galactic centers, which can have billions of times the mass of the sun, but have a good deal more mass than the black holes formed when giant stars collapse.
The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image belwo shows a galaxy known as UGC 11411. It is a galaxy type known as an irregular blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxy.
 

 
BCD galaxies are about a tenth of the size of a typical spiral galaxy such as the Milky Way and are made up of large clusters of hot, massive stars that ionize the surrounding gas with their intense radiation. Because these stars are so hot they glow brightly with a blue hue, giving galaxies like UGC 11411 their characteristic blue tint. With these massive stars being less than 10 million years old, they are very young compared to stellar standards. They were created during a starburst, a galaxy-wide episode of furious star formation. UGC 11411 in particular has an extremely high star formation rate, even for a BCD galaxy.
Unusually for galaxies with such intense star-forming regions, BCDs don’t contain either a lot of dust, or the heavy elements that are typically found as trace elements in recently formed stars, making their composition very similar to that of the material from which the first stars formed in the early universe. Because of this astronomers consider BCD galaxies to be good objects to study to improve our understanding of primordial star-forming processes. The bright stars in the image are foreground stars in our own Milky Way galaxy.

  <p>(University of Bonn) To date, research on the effects of climate change has underestimated the contribution of seawater expansion to sea level rise due to warming of the oceans. A team of researchers at the University of Bonn has now investigated, using satellite data, that this effect was almost twice as large over the past twelve years than previously assumed. That may result in, for example, significantly increased risks of storm surges. The scientists are presenting their findings in the renowned scientific journal ‘PNAS’.</p>

  <p>The Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has launched a new programme that aims to create an implantable neural device that will allow unparalleled connectivity between the human brain and the digital realm.
The device will act as a sort of digital translator, capable of transforming electrochemical signals originating in the brain into binary code, which computing technology is able to understand.
The wider aim is to enhance the research capabilities of neurotechnology
“Today’s best brain-computer interface systems are like two supercomputers trying to talk to each other using an old 300-baud modem”, said Phillip Alvelda, the Neural Engineering System Design (NESD) programme manager. “Imagine what will become possible when we upgrade our tools to really open the channel between the human brain and modern electronics.”
The agency is aiming to create a biocompatible device that is no larger than one cubic centimetre, making it as minimally invasive as possible.
The neural implant is just one of the projects DARPA and the NESD programme are working on. The wider aim is to enhance the research capabilities of neurotechnology in order to better understand the brain and how it functions, and discover new therapies. Among the programme’s potential applications are devices that could compensate for deficits in sight or hearing by feeding digital auditory or visual information into the brain at a resolution and experiential quality far higher than is possible with current technology.
The NESD programme is one part of a much larger project within DARPA that aims to support President Barack Obama’s BRAIN initiative, launched in April 2013.</p>

This past August, scientists working with CERN's ALICE (a Large Ion Collider Experiment), a heavy-ion detector on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) ring, made precise measurements of particle mass and electric charge that confirm the existence of a fundamental symmetry in nature. "After the Big Bang, for every particle of matter an antiparticle was created. In particle physics, a very important question is whether all the laws of physics display a specific kind of symmetry known as CPT, and these measurements suggest that there is indeed a fundamental symmetry between nuclei and antinuclei," said Marcelo Gameiro Munhoz, a professor at the University of São Paulo (USP).

ALICE is one of the largest experiments in the world devoted to research in the physics of matter at an infinitely small scale. Hosted at CERN, the European Laboratory for Nuclear Research, this project involves an international collaboration of more than 1500 physicists, engineers and technicians, including around 350 graduate students, from 154 physics institutes in 37 countries across the world.
The ALICE Experiment is going in search of answers to fundamental questions, using the extraordinary tools provided by the LHC: What happens to matter when it is heated to 100,000 times the temperature at the centre of the Sun ? Why do protons and neutrons weigh 100 times more than the quarks they are made of?Can the quarks inside the protons and neutrons be freed?
The findings, reported in a paper published online in Nature Physics led the researchers to confirm a fundamental symmetry between the nuclei of the particles and their antiparticles in terms of charge, parity and time (CPT).
These measurements of particles produced in high-energy collisions of heavy ions in the LHC were made possible by the ALICE experiment's high-precision tracking and identification capabilities, as part of an investigation designed to detect subtle differences between the ways in which protons and neutrons join in nuclei while their antiparticles form antinuclei.
 
       
 
 
Munhoz is the principal investigator for the research project "High-energy nuclear physics at RHIC and LHC", supported by São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP). The project--a collaboration between the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the United States and ALICE at the LHC, operated by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland--consists of experimental activities relating to the study of relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
Among other objectives, the Brazilian researchers involved with ALICE seek to understand the production of heavy quarks (charm and bottom quarks) based on the measurement of electrons using an electromagnetic calorimeter and, more recently, Sampa, a microchip developed in Brazil to study rarer phenomena arising from heavy-ion collisions in the LHC.
According to Munhoz, the measurements of mass and charge performed in the symmetry experiment, combined with other studies, will help physicists to determine which of the many theories on the fundamental laws of the universe is most plausible. "These laws describe the nature of all matter interactions," he said, "so it's important to know that physical interactions aren't changed by particle charge reversal, parity transformation, reflections of spatial coordinates and time inversion. The key question is whether the laws of physics remain the same under such conditions."
In particular, the researchers measured the mass-over-charge ratio differences for deuterons, consisting of a proton and a neutron, and antideuterons, as well as for nuclei of helium-3, comprising two protons and one neutron, and antihelium-3. Recent measurements at CERN compared the same properties of protons and antiprotons at high resolution.
The ALICE experiment records high-energy collisions of lead ions at the LHC, enabling the study of matter at extremely high temperatures and densities. The lead-ion collisions provide an abundant source of particles and antiparticles, producing nuclei and the corresponding antinuclei at nearly equal rates. This allows ALICE to make a detailed comparison of the properties of the nuclei and antinuclei that are most copiously produced. The experiment makes precise measurements of both the curvature of particle tracks in the detector's magnetic field and the particles' time of flight and uses this information to determine the mass-to-charge ratios for nuclei and antinuclei.
The high precision of the time-of-flight detector, which determines the arrival time of particles and antiparticles with a resolution of 80 picoseconds and is associated with the energy-loss measurement provided by the time-projection chamber, allows the scientists involved to measure a clear signal for deuterons/antideuterons and helium-3/antihelium-3, the particles studied in the similarity experiment.

<blockquote>
  <p>Emily Whitehead was just 5 years old when she fell ill with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common type of childhood cancer. Most kids beat the disease within two years, but Emily relapsed twice after several rounds of chemotherapy.
Desperate to find a treatment, her parents enrolled her in an experimental trial at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in early 2012. CHOP’s doctors drew her blood and collected some of Emily’s T lymphocytes — white blood cells that form the backbone of the human immune system. The team then reprogrammed the cells by altering their DNA so they would recognize and kill Emily’s cancer. Doctors injected them back into Emily’s bloodstream, where the cells multiplied and wiped out the disease.
Emily has remained cancer-free since. She’s become the poster child for a new type of personalized medicine called cellular immunotherapy, a type of regenerative medicine that seeks to fix faulty cells and tissues by reengineering their DNA and restoring their normal function. “We are on the cusp of a revolution in medicine,” says Phil Vanek, general manager for cell therapy technologies at GE Healthcare. “These are living drugs. The reprogrammed cell itself becomes the treatment that gets reintroduced to the patient. Ordinary drugs wear off after we take them, but regenerative medicine can have a durable effect. It can restore a function that was lost or, someday, give our cells one they never had.”

GE helped design the bioreactor CHOP doctors used to grow Emily’s cancer-trained T cells and has a number of products and services used in cell therapy manufacturing today. However, the company doesn’t want to innovate in a vacuum. Vanek believes the more collaboration he and his team can encourage in the industry, the faster these therapies get to the market. That’s why GE and the Canadian government will each invest CA$20 million in a new cell therapy research and process development hub in Toronto led by Canada’s Centre for Commercialization of Regenerative Medicine (CCRM). Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the news this week.
The new center will bring together researchers, universities, drug manufacturers and technology companies like GE to speed up the development and production of cell therapies and make them available to patients more quickly. “Cell therapy has the potential to cure everything from cancer to diabetes,” Vanek says. “But we need to make it affordable and scalable. In this era of increasing scrutiny of medical costs and reimbursement, we have to help our customers achieve a reasonable cost of goods.”

In 1961, James Till and Ernest McCulloch discovered stem cells here while working at the Ontario Cancer Institute and the University of Toronto. Stem cells will likely be key to regenerative medicine. They have the ability to turn themselves into many other different cells in the body, like blood, muscle and skin cells, and potentially repair damaged organs.
Today the city boasts a rich research and bioengineering ecosystem. Since CCRM opened in 2011, the not-for-profit has brought together 50 partners, including academic teams, pharmaceutical and technology companies, investors and regulators. The new center will be located inside Toronto’s 1-million-square-foot MaRS Discovery District, sharing the space with Facebook, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s JLabs, Autodesk and venture investors. The main University of Toronto campus, a cluster of hospitals and the Ontario legislative assembly are right next door. “We need to integrate existing technology to break through manufacturing bottlenecks and make cell therapy affordable and available,” says CCRM President and CEO Michael May. “This rich environment will help us validate new clinical technologies and turn them into lucrative products.”

GE, one of CCRM’s founding partners, will play an anchor role in the new hub. The company has more than three decades of experience making biologics, the fastest-growing class of drugs, which includes best-sellers like Herceptin, Remicade, Humira and Avastin. Biologics are proteins grown by genetically modified cells cultured in tanks called bioreactors. GE makes bioreactors as well as other technology required to produce these drugs. “In the biopharmaceutical industry, we use cells in bioreactors to make these therapeutic proteins,” GE’s Vanek says. “We can use similar technology to multiply reengineered cells for cell therapy. Just like cells producing proteins, cells for therapy have to be washed, multiplied, purified, concentrated and packaged. We already know how to do that. But unlike bioprocessing, where the cells are discarded and only the protein is saved, we collect intact living cells and this introduces added complexity to the process.”
Vanek has other tools in his kit. In many ways, GE Healthcare’s cell therapy business is the perfect example of what the company calls the GE Store — the ability to share knowledge across many domains. The team works with GE’s bioprocess business in Uppsala, the HyClone team in Cardiff, software engineers in Bangalore and San Ramone, scientists at GE Global Research and GE Ventures. They will be also using Predix, the cloud-based software platform for the Industrial Internet developed by GE Digital. “Our fate is determined by these collaborations,” Vanek says.
For example, cellular immunotherapy starts with the patient’s own cells. Vanek says Predix could allow manufacturers to keep a digital chain of custody of those cells. “We call it the digital thread and already use it in manufacturing,” he says. “It could allow us to track cells through the whole reprogramming and manufacturing process. We could run real-time analytics during the process and then ultimately follow the patient results. Since every patient introduces a level of biological variability, we envision smart systems in the future that could adapt the production process in real-time depending on the biology that’s coming in.”
Last year GE launched the GE Health Cloud, which allows hospitals to collect and work with patient data. Vanek says that, to be broadly adopted, cell therapy manufacturing processes will have to be flexible, push-button, sterile and disposable.
The new center will help, says CCRM’s May. He believes that better-designed cell therapy tool kits for clinical production could be available within a few years, and “manufacturing blueprints” by the end of the decade. Says May: “The new investment will help us break through the manufacturing bottlenecks and get us there.”

  <p>In “Star Trek,” a transporter can teleport a person from one location to a remote location without actually making the journey along the way. Such a transporter has fascinated many people. Quantum teleportation shares several features of the transporter and is one of the most important protocols in quantum information. In a recent study, Prof. Tongcang Li at Purdue University and Dr. Zhang-qi Yin at Tsinghua University proposed the first scheme to use electromechanical oscillators and superconducting circuits to teleport the internal quantum state (memory) and center-of-mass motion state of a microorganism. They also proposed a scheme to create a Schrödinger’s cat state in which a microorganism can be in two places at the same time. This is an important step toward potentially teleporting an organism in future.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Phys.org)—In many ways, water behaves very differently than other liquids do, and with important consequences: It’s widely thought that water’s unusual properties were essential for the development of life on Earth. One prime example is the fact that ice floats. Unlike other substances, frozen water is less dense than liquid water, and this anomaly allows fish and other aquatic lifeforms to survive in the water under a frozen layer of protective ice during cold periods. Water also has a high heat capacity, meaning it can absorb and release a large amount of heat while undergoing very little change in temperature. This property helps many living organisms maintain a relatively stable body temperature, and it also provides a pleasant climate in Europe due to the warm Gulf Stream current.</p>

  <p>How a simple compass oriented one of humanity’s greatest minds toward the truth of things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Behind the cotton wool is hidden a pattern,” Virginia Woolf wrote in her breathtaking recollection of the insight that made her an artist. “The whole world is a work of art… there is no Shakespeare… no Beethoven… no God; we are the words; we are the music; we are the thing itself.” 
In 1946, five years after Woolf’s death, another one of humanity’s most luminous and expansive minds recounted arriving at a strikingly similar notion via a strikingly similar formative experience.</p>

<p>In a passage from his Autobiographical Notes (public library), sixty-seven-year-old Albert Einstein (March 14, 1879–April 18, 1955) considers the nature of wonderment:
I have no doubt that our thinking goes on for the most part without use of signs (words) and beyond that to a considerable degree unconsciously. For how, otherwise, should it happen that we sometimes “wonder” quite spontaneously about some experience? This “wondering” appears to occur when an experience comes into conflict with a world of concepts already sufficiently fixed within us. Whenever such a conflict is experienced sharply and intensely it reacts back upon our world of thought in a decisive way. The development of this world of thought is in a certain sense a continuous flight from “wonder.” 
A wonder of this kind I experienced as a child of four or five years when my father showed me a compass. That this needle behaved in such a determined way did not at all fit in the kind of occurrences that could find a place in the unconscious world of concepts (efficacy produced by direct “touch”). I can still remember — or at least believe I can remember — that this experience made a deep and lasting impression upon me. Something deeply hidden had to be behind things.
Complement Autobiographical Notes, a revelatory read in its slim but potent entirety, with Einstein on kindness, the secret to learning anything, the common language of science, his exquisite love letters, and this lovely picture-book biography of the great scientist.

<p> 
Scientists at the Max Planck Society have investigated the hypothesis that the first protein domains arose by fusion and piecemeal growth from an ancestral set of simple peptides, which themselves emerged in an RNA-based pre-cellular life, around 3.5 billion years ago.
Proteins and languages share many similarities – both, for instance, yield their meaning through a proper arrangement of basic building blocks. Andrei Lupas, Director at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Germany, and his team apply computational methods to reconstruct primordial building blocks by comparative studies of modern proteins. The same approach is used in linguistics to reconstruct ancient vocabularies through the comparison of modern languages.
In a recent study the scientists report the identification of 40 ancestral, peptidic fragments, which possibly represent the observable remnants of a time when the first proteins were created, more than 3.5 billion years ago.
Proteins are integral building blocks of all life, from bacteria to humans. In our bodies, they are essential for all chemical processes: they form our nails, hair, bones, and muscles, they help digest the food we eat, and they defend us form pathogenic bacteria and viruses.
“Life can be viewed as substantially resulting from the chemical activity of proteins”, says Lupas, Director of the Department of Protein Evolution at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology. He and his collaborators are particularly interested in understanding how these complex biomolecules originated. Today we know that proteins are primarily built through the combinatorial assembly of only a few thousand modular units, termed domains. It is however unclear how these modular units themselves emerged.
In a systematic analysis of modern proteins, they were able to identify 40 peptidic fragments that occur in seemingly unrelated proteins, yet bear striking resemblance in their sequences and structures. Based on their widespread occurrence in the most ancient proteins (e.g., ribosomal proteins) and on their involvement in basal functions (e.g., RNA-binding, DNA-binding), the authors propose that these fragments are the observable remnants of a primordial RNA-peptide world, a precursor form of the DNA-based life we know today.
In the future, the contribution of these fragments to the formation of protein structure will have to be investigated experimentally, opening new avenues to optimize existing proteins and design new ones, not yet seen in nature. “If we elucidate this process, we should be able to create new protein forms”, concludes Lupas, with exciting applications to biotechnology.
