And some of these adaptations are in an unlikely part of their anatomy - their brains.

>A lab experiment has all but nixed one of the theories of dark energy, a mysterious force pushing the universe apart. This diagram shows changes in the rate of expansion since the Big Bang. About 7.5 billion years ago, astronomers observe the effects of a mysterious force that causes galaxies to fly apart at a faster rate. NASA / WMAP One of the most bizarre discoveries of the 21st century was that the universe is expanding at an accelerating speed. The culprit behind this ramp-up, called dark energy for lack of a better term, is an unknown force that’s pushing the universe’s expansion so that as cosmic time goes on, galaxies fly faster and faster apart. Yet despite its implications for the fate of our universe, astronomers have no idea wha...

>Artist&#8217;s rendition of the Earth and Sun. It may not seem like it to us, but our planet is moving at incredible speeds. In fact, every hour, our planet moves approximately 67,000 miles  (or 107,000) in its orbit around the Sun. But how do we know this? After all, it&#8217;s not like there is a great cosmic radar that we can look at in order to clock our speed. It may seem like a rather difficult question to answer, but really, it only requires a little knowledge of geometry. To begin with, we know that the Earth completes one orbit every 365 days. Well, technically, a year is just a little longer than this. In truth, a years is actually 365.25 days long. That&#8217;s why, every four years, we have an extra day (we&#8217;re playing a bi...

Four researchers explain why a better understanding of how certain stars die can help reveal the evolution of the cosmos and its galaxies. This simulated image depicts the explosive death of a white dwarf as a Type Ia supernova with a stellar companion. When the supernova explodes (dark brown), its ejected material slams into the companion star (light blue). The violent collision produces an ultraviolet pulse, which is emitted from the conical hole carved out by the companion star.
