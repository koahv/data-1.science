For decades, scientists have been trying to directly observe both of these features. Now, they have finally done it. For the first time ever, scientists have captured a snapshot of this duality.

>The particle-wave nature of light has fascinated researchers for more than 200 years, but a new experiment has allowed researchers to visualize it like never before. This image was taken by turning an electron microscope on a laser-charged nanowire. Light moved down the wire in both directions, creating a standing wave of photons, which the electron microscope was able to capture by focusing on the wire. The result is an image that captures both the wave and particle nature of light. A wave is clearly visible in the curves of the figure, but each data point represents a unique interaction between a photon and an electron, slowing or speeding the electron enough to be measured by the microscope.

>(Phys.org)—Photonic quantum technologies – including cryptography, enhanced measurement and information processing – face a conundrum: They require single photons, but these are difficult to create, manipulate and measure. At the same time, quantum memories enable these technologies by acting as a photonic buffer. Therefore, an ideal part of the solution would be a single-photon on-demand read/write quantum memory. To date, however, development of a practical single-photon quantum memory has been stymied by (1) the need for high efficiency, (2) the read/write lasers used introducing noise that contaminates the quantum state, and (3) decoherence of the information stored in the memory....

>5 Basic Principles of Linux System Security It is still common that people do not know where to start when it comes to information security. With 5 basic principles we can improve the Linux system security and question ourselves if we have done enough. &nbsp; 1. Know your system(s) The first principle is about knowing what your system is supposed to do. What is its primary role, what software packages does it need and who needs access? By knowing the role of the system you can better defend it against known and unknown threats. &nbsp; Security Measures: &nbsp; Password policy Proper software patch management Configuration management Documentation &nbsp; 2. Least Amount of Privilege Each process running, or package installed, might become...

The black hole's mass is 12 billion solar masses, and the surrounding quasar pumped out 10^15 times the sun's energy. An international team of astronomers have found a huge and ancient black hole which was powering the brightest object early in the universe. "Forming such a large black hole so quickly is hard to interpret with current theories," said Fuyan Bian, from the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Australian National University. Bian said the discovery challenges theories of how black holes form and grow in the early universe. The black hole's mass is 12 billion times that of the Sun, and i...

>       As the sun skims through the galaxy, it flings out charged particles in a stream of plasma called the solar wind, and the solar wind creates a bubble extending far outside the solar system known as the heliosphere. For decades, scientists have visualized the heliosphere as shaped like a comet, with a very long tail extending thousands of times as far as the distance from the Earth to the sun. New research suggests that the sun's magnetic field controls the large-scale shape of the heliosphere "much more than had been previously thought," says Merav Opher, associate professor of astronomy and director of the Center for Space Physics at Boston University (BU). In the new model, the magnetic field squeezes the solar wind along the...
