Previous observations from Earth have only been able to record Pluto's atmosphere reaching 170 miles out into space.

>By Mike Keller At the most fundamental level, we are all code. The typical human body is an assembly of some 37 trillion cells, and each holds all the information needed to make a complete human being. Our DNA, the double-stranded helix responsible for heredity, contains 3 billion letters that dictate everything from hair and skin color to blood type. In fact, DNA is the most important identity document we will ever carry. Besides random mutations and damage, it doesn’t change from the day we’re born. But that paradigm may soon start to shift. Scientists around the world have been experimenting with a powerful new tool called the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which has begun to open up the possibility of rewriting faulty or unwanted human, animal...

Today, programs like the Human Protein Atlas are zooming in even deeper, mapping out not just the DNA that defines our bodies, but also the building blocks – specifically, the proteins – that make them tick (or sick). We’ve known for a while that human DNA holds about 20,000 human genes that code for proteins. But it was only late last year that scientists led by Mathias Uhlén of the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, published the first comprehensive open-source map of 17,000 human proteins...

>By Tomas Kellner Building something new usually takes a lot of brains, effort and time. When GE decided to put blades made from untested carbon fiber composites inside a brand new jet engine, replacing titanium with what was essentially plastic, it also required a lot of nerves. “The design team woke up every morning thinking about it, and went to bed every night thinking about it,” says David Joyce, chief executive of GE Aviation. “It was such a radical change in design.”Top: A GE90 engine on a brand new China Airlines Boeing 777.

Among the findings of the report, the analysis shows that the world’s total solar energy capacity now stands at 178GW, with 40GW created in 2014, up from 37GW created in 2013. The three European nations mentioned previously got the gold stars from SPE because their total national solar energy creation now accounts for 7pc of their entire energy output. However, the UK were the most proactive in 2014, constructing 2.4GW-worth of solar energy, followed by Germany (1.9GW) and France (927MW). China has maintained its position as the world’s lar...
