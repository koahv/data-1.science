  <p>(Phys.org) —It’s been a big week for solving mysteries—first up, a breakthrough has been made in identifying the origin of superconductivity in high temperature superconductors. A team at the University of Cambridge found that moving electrons created twisted “pockets” of electrons in the materials from which superconductivity emerged. Also an Egyptologist unravels an  ancient mystery—turns out an ancient army wasn’t destroyed by a sand storm after all, it was conquered by another army and then covered up by the losing side. And in Quantum biology: Algae evolved to switch quantum coherence on and off—researchers at UNSW in Australia have uncovered how a type of algae is able to exist in extremely low-light conditions and the discovery adds to the growing list of observations that indicate that quantum phenomena are operating in nature.</p>

  <p>Hi all, As a big Mortal Kombat fan, I've posted before about MK9 and had pretty much zero luck getting any attention from NetherRealm. I'm hoping that as MKX has only recently been announced we may still be able to sway them to support Linux. My plan is to tweet @NetherRealm, @noobde and @WB_Games_UK asking them to support SteamOS for Mortal Kombat X, I will also make a post in the Steam forums when I get a spare moment (and I'll link it here). Even if this doesn't succeed, I'm hoping we can at least get a response to this (like we did with Borderlands and 2K games), and put us on the radar for WB Games! Guys &amp; gals of Linux_Gaming, please consider helping. Your voices really do count, as seen with the previous 2K games example! If you know of any other ways to get their attention, please post it here. THANKS!  submitted by  DarwinKamikaze   [link] [33 comments]</p>

Richard Dawkins -famed Oxford evolutionary biologist reflecting on the emergence of life on Earth and the evolutionary process in his classic The Ancestor's Tale: "The universe could so easily have remained lifeless and simple -just physics and chemistry, just the scattered dust of the cosmic explosion that gave birth to time and space. The fact that it did not -the fact that life evolved out of literally nothing, some 10 billion years after the universe evolved literally out of nothing -is a fact so staggering that I would be mad to attempt words to do it justice. And even that is not the end of the matter. Not only did evolution happen: it eventually led to beings capable of comprehending the process by which they comprehend it."
It's no accident that we see stars in the sky, says Dawkins: they are a vital part of any universe capable of generating us. But, as Dawkins emphasizes, that does not mean that stars exists in order to make us."It is just that without stars there would be no atoms heavier than lithium in the periodic table," Dawkins wrote in The Ancestors Tale -- A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution, "and a chemistry of only three elements is too impoverished to support life. Seeing is the kind of activity that can go on only in the kind of universe where what you see is stars."
"It's an astonishing stroke of luck that we are here." That was Dawkins' evolutionary message at a recent speech to a packed auditorium at the Christchurch, New Zealand. "Every animal owes its existence to an astonishing list of contingencies that might not have happened. With so much chance and luck it might be thought that evolution itself is a process of pure chance, but nothing could be further from the truth."
It was predictable, for example, that eyes and ears would develop in different species, and they had done so independently several times over, Dawkins said. "Natural selection is the great engine of the predictable side of life, but it cannot start without certain prerequisites."
Dawkins said it was his gut feeling that there has been another stroke of luck that would have developed life elsewhere in the Universe.
"There are billions and billions of planets out there, so there could be millions of planets that have life on them, but the origin of life could still be a staggeringly good stroke of luck," he said.
To Richard Dawkins believing in God is like believing in a teapot orbiting Mars. Dawkins said that a sense of gratitude had developed as an essential part of human societies. This meant humans had an overwhelming desire to give thanks, even when there was no-one to give thanks to and this, in part, had given rise to religion.
Dawkins sees himself as a "religious non-believer" who's career has revolved around Darwin's view that all was 'produced by laws acting around us' described so powerfully by Darwin in the Origin of the Species:
"Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving -- namely, the production of the higher animals -- directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."

The team of astrophysicists led by John Kovac of Harvard who announced just months ago what they acheived a breakthrough in confirming how the universe was born when they identified gravitational waves that rippled through space right after the Big Bang now admit they may be wrong. The detection was made with the help of a telescope called BICEP2, stationed at the South Pole. BICEP2 stands for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization. If proven to be correctly identified, these waves -- predicted in Albert Einstein's theory of relativity -- would confirm the rapid and violent growth spurt of the universe in the first fraction of a second marking its existence, 13.8 billion years ago.
The apparent first direct evidence of such so-called cosmic inflation -- a theory that the universe expanded by 100 trillion trillion times in barely the blink of an eye -- was announced in March by experts at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
"Detecting this signal is one of the most important goals in cosmology today," John Kovac, leader of the BICEP2 collaboration at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said at the time. By observing the cosmic microwave background, or a faint glow left over from the Big Bang, the scientists said small fluctuations gave them new clues about the conditions in the early universe.
By observing the cosmic microwave background, or a faint glow left over from the Big Bang, the scientists said small fluctuations gave them new clues about the conditions in the early universe. The gravitational waves rippled through the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, and these images were captured by the telescope, they claimed. If confirmed by other experts, some said the work could be a contender for the Nobel Prize.
After weeks in which they avoided the media, the team published its work last Thursday in the US journal Physical Review Letters. The team concluded that their models "are not sufficiently constrained by external public data to exclude the possibility of dust emission bright enough to explain the entire excess signal," as stated by other scientists who questioned their conclusion.
Paul Steinhardt, director of Princeton University's Center for Theoretical Science, addressed the issue in the prestigious British journal Nature in early June. "Serious flaws in the analysis have been revealed that transform the sure detection into no detection," Steinhardt wrote, citing an independent analysis of the BICEP2 findings.
That analysis was carried out by David Spergel, a theoretical astrophysicist who is also at Princeton. Spergel queried whether what the BICEP2 telescope picked up really came from the first moments of the universe's existence. "What I think, it is not certain whether polarized emissions come from galactic dust or from the early universe," he told AFP.
When using just one frequency, as these scientists did, it is impossible to distinguish between gravitational waves and galactic emissions, Spergel added.
"We know that galactic dust emits polarized radiations. We see that in many areas of the sky, and what we pointed out in our paper is that pattern they have seen is just as consistent with the galactic dust radiations as with gravitational waves," Spergel told AFP last week. He added that the question will likely be settled in the coming months when another, competing group, working with the European Space Agency's Planck telescope, publishes its results.
That telescope observes a large part of the sky -- versus the BICEP2's two percent -- and carries out measurements in six frequencies, compared to just one for BICEP2, according to Spergel. "I think in retrospect, they should have been more careful about making a big announcement," he said.
Philipp Mertsch of the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at Stanford University said data from Planck and another team should be able to "shed more light on whether it is primordial gravitational waves or dust in the Milky Way. Let me stress, however, that what is leaving me (and many of my colleagues) unsatisfied with the state of affairs: If it is polarized dust emission, where is it coming from?" he said in an email to AFP.

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  At his blog, Tantek Çelik writes about the ninth birthday of the microformats effort, which seeks to express semantic information in web pages through the use of attribute names within HTML elements, in contrast to comparatively "heavyweight" schemes like RDFa and Microdata. Çelik notes that the community-driven process of microformats' development seems to have enabled its survival. "Looking back nine years ago, none of the other alternatives promoted in the 2000s (even by big companies like Google and Yahoo) survive to this day in any meaningful way," he says. "Large companies tend to promote more complex solutions, perhaps because they can afford the staff, time, and other resources to develop and support complex solutions. Such approaches fundamentally lack empathy for independent developers and designers, who don't have time to keep up with all the complexity." In addition to his analysis about the past nine years (including an exploration of the down side of email-based discussions), Çelik takes the occasion to announce that microformats2 has now been upgraded to the status of ready-to-use recommendation, and points site maintainers to tools to support the transition.

  <p><span style="color: #5274ae;">Despite skepticism from scientists and politicians alike, NASA is proceeding with its asteroid redirect mission and has found six candidates for exploration so far.Usually, the saying goes, getting there is half the battle. In the case of <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/nasa-to-snag-a-near-earth-asteroid/">NASA’s Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM), finding “there” might be the bigger challenge.&lt;div
id="attachment_255425088" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;<a href="http://d366w3m5tf0813.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/ARM_OptionA_480px.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-255425088" src="http://d366w3m5tf0813.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/ARM_OptionA_480px-300x171.jpg" alt="Asteroid retrieval mission, opion A" width="300" height="171" />&lt;p
class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This concept shows ARM robotic capture Option A in which the robotic vehicle deploys an inflatable bag to envelop a free-flying small asteroid before redirecting it to a lunar distant retrograde orbit.<br />NASAWhen NASA first announced the mission to find, retrieve, and explore an asteroid, the <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/asteroid-plan-looks-rocky-1.13391" target="_blank">community reacted with skepticism. Finding asteroids, especially small ones, is hard — and finding small asteroids with just the right criteria for a robotic rendezvous is even harder. <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/asteroid-scheme-still-underway/">An alternative option, flying to a bigger asteroid and retrieving a boulder off its surface, was even added as a possibility to help enlarge the pool of candidates.Now NASA has announced that they have collected six “valid candidates” between the two options, where “valid” indicates that follow-up observations show the objects meet rendezvous criteria.For Option A, which aims to bag a whole, small asteroid and bring it back to lunar retrograde orbit, the three criteria are size, spin rate, and mass. Mission planners have three valid candidates so far: 2009 BD, 2013 EC20, and a new candidate announced yesterday, 2011 MD. Each candidate is less than about 10 meters across and spins less than once every 2 minutes. The mass limit depends on the asteroid’s orbit.&lt;div
id="attachment_255425089" style="width: 289px" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;<a href="http://d366w3m5tf0813.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2011MD_Spitzer_350px.jpg"><img class="wp-image-255425089 size-medium" src="http://d366w3m5tf0813.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2011MD_Spitzer_350px-279x190.jpg" alt="2011 MD infrared image" width="279" height="190" />&lt;p
class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Spitzer stared at 2011 MD for 20 hours to capture this infrared image, enabling astronomers to measure the asteroid’s temperature, and hence its size and density.<br /> NASA / JPL-Caltech / Northern Arizona University / SAO2011 MD, the biggest candidate so far, is between 4 and 10 meters across (13 to 32 feet) and has a surprisingly low density, roughly that of water. Based on the size and density, its mass is somewhere between 50 and 350 tons. This asteroid passed very close to Earth in 2011, enabling its discovery and tweaking its orbit such that it’s a good target for a rendezvous in 2024.Earlier this year, NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope, whose orbit trails Earth’s, stared at 2011 MD for 20 hours to characterize the object’s temperature, and therefore its size. The low density probably means that the asteroid is really a fleet of flying boulders, though it’s also possible that the asteroid is a single rock surrounded by a haze of smaller rock particles.Regardless of the asteroid’s true nature, Option A would have the robotic spacecraft grab the whole thing in a bag and haul it back to an orbit 70,000 km above the lunar surface.&lt;div
id="attachment_7784" style="width: 351px" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;<a href="http://d366w3m5tf0813.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Itokawa-Oct405-341.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7784 size-full" src="http://d366w3m5tf0813.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Itokawa-Oct405-341.jpg" alt="Asteroid Itokawa" width="341" height="213" />&lt;p
class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The Hayabusa spacecraft acquired this view of 25143 Itokawa on October 4, 2005, hours after moving to within 7 km of the asteroid. The rough-textured terrain shows evidence for retrievable boulders.<br />JAXAThe alternative, Option B, involves retrieving a boulder from a larger asteroid and has fewer constraints, requiring only an accessible orbit and confirmation of boulders on the asteroid’s surface. But observational evidence for boulders is hard to obtain. So far, three candidates have made the list for Option B: Itokawa (pictured at right), 2008 EV5, and 101955 Bennu, the target of the <a href="http://www.asteroidmission.org/%20" target="_blank">upcoming OSIRIS-Rex mission.In addition to widening the playing field of potential targets, Option B has a side benefit: testing planetary defense. Option A by definition has NASA targeting asteroids that are too small to matter when it comes to close encounters — if these asteroids ever ventured too near Earth, they would mostly burn up in the atmosphere. But Option B targets asteroids 100 times larger, and the robotic spacecraft could demonstrate techniques such as the <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7065/abs/438177a.html" target="_blank">gravity tractor or <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.1276" target="_blank">ion-beam deflection either before or after picking up the boulder.Paul Chodas (NASA JPL) estimated that NASA’s searches might find an additional two to three candidate asteroids per year until 2018, at which time the agency will have to decide both which option they’re going with and which asteroid they’ll target for a projected 2019 launch.As the search for asteroid candidates continues, work begins on retrieval mechanisms. NASA also announced yesterday 18 proposals that will share $4.9 million over the next six months to investigate technology for rendezvous sensors, asteroid capture, adapting commercial spacecraft, and more. <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-selects-studies-for-the-asteroid-redirect-mission/" target="_blank">See NASA’s press release for the full list of accepted proposals.Facing the Skeptics&lt;div

class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Despite meeting rendezvous criteria, the asteroid 2011 MD is still a bit of a mystery. It might be a rubble pile (left) or a single rock clouded by rock particle haze (right).<br />NASA / JPL-CaltechNASA’s announcement was intended no doubt to soothe critics in the political and scientific communities alike. Just last week, the <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/us-panel-sets-sights-on-mars-1.15358" target="_blank">U.S. National Academy of Sciences issued a report that urged a return to the Moon rather than a singular focus on asteroid retrieval. Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2482/1" target="_blank">lawmakers have voiced their unease about the asteroid retrieval mission’s lack of a firm schedule and budget.“Our briefing reminded the community that we have some viable candidates already for this proposed mission,” Chodas says, “and the prospects are good for finding more viable candidates.”But Jim Bell (Arizona State University), president of The Planetary Society, counters, “Finding suitable targets is just one step in NASA proving that the Asteroid Retrieval Mission is a feasible project.” As described in a <a href="http://www.planetary.org/press-room/releases/2014/0527-the-planetary-society-announces-support-for-nasas-asteroid-initiative.html" target="_blank">recent statement from The Planetary Society, the agency also needs to produce an independent assessment of the mission’s likely costs and of the technical implementation that NASA plans to pursue, he explains.  “Hopefully those additional steps will be coming soon.”&lt;hr

An international team of scientists have discovered that winds blowing from a supermassive black hole in a nearby galaxy work to obscure observations and x-rays. The discovery sheds light on the unexpected behavior of black holes, which emit large amounts of matter through powerful, galactic winds. Using a large array of satellites and space observatories, the team spent more than a year training their instruments on the brightest and most studied of the “local” black holes — the one situated at the core of Type I Seyfert Galaxy NGC 5548. “Shadowing” of light from a black hole had not been seen before. With the discovery, scientists were able to decipher the outflow.
“These outflows are thought to be a major player in the structure formation of the universe,” said Nahum Arav, an associate professor of physics with Virginia Tech. “This particular outflow is comparatively small but because it’s so close we can study it very well and then create a better understanding of how the phenomenon will work in very large objects that do affect the structure formation in the universe.”
The researchers discovered much colder gas than expected based on past observations, showing that the wind had cooled and that a stream of gas moved quickly outward and blocked 90 percent of x-rays. The observation was the first direct evidence of an obscuration process that — in more luminous galaxies — has been shown to regulate growth of black holes.
By looking at data from different sources, scientists found that a thick layer of gas lay between the galactic nucleus and the Earth blocked the lower energy x-rays often used to study the system, but allowed more energetic x-rays to get through. Data from Hubble Space Telescope also showed ultraviolet emissions being partially absorbed by a stream of gas. “I don’t think anyone has trained so many scopes and put in so much time on a single object like this,” said Arav. “The result is quite spectacular. We saw something that was never studied well before and we also deciphered the outflow in the object. We know far more about this outflow than any studied previously as to where it is and how it behaves in time. We have a physical model that explains all the data we’ve taken of the outflow over 16 years.”
The discovery was made by an international team led by SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research scientist Jelle Kaastra using the major space observatories of the European Space Agency, NASA, the Hubble Space Telescope, Swift, NuSTAR, Chandra, INTREGRAL, and other satellites and observation platforms.
“Until now our knowledge of these characteristics was very limited,” Arav said. “Before we were making educated inferences — but now we know. We know the distance of outflow from the center of source, we know the mass of outflow, and we know what causes its observed changes. The shadowing was definitely a surprise —a beautiful phenomenon we were lucky to catch.”
Over the past two years the shadowing has built up and Arav believes it won’t last much longer than another year or two, but concedes scientists don’t have a full enough observation to say how the shadowing feature is changing in time.
The supermassive black hole at the center of the spiral galaxy NGC 4151 has created a structure that astronomers call the “Eye of Sauron,” after the evil wizard in J.R.R. Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings” novels. This image is a composite of images taken by several different telescopes.

"Humans obviously evolved a much wider range of communication tools to express their thoughts, the most important being language," said John Hoffecker, a fellow at the University of Colorado's Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research. "Individual human brains within social groups became integrated into a neurologic Internet of sorts, giving birth to the mind."
There is abundant fossil and archaeological evidence for the evolution of the human mind, including its unique power to create a potentially infinite variety of thoughts expressed in the form of sentences, art and technologies," according to Hoffecker. "He attributes the evolving power of the mind to the formation of what he calls the "super-brain," or collective mind, an event that took place in Africa no later than 75,000 years ago.
An internationally known archaeologist who has worked at sites in Europe and the Arctic, Hoffecker said the formation of the super-brain was a consequence of a rare ability to share complex thoughts among individual brains. Among other creatures on Earth, the honeybee may be the best example of an organism that has mastered the trick of communicating complex information -- including maps of food locations and information on potential nest sites from one brain to another -- using their intricate "waggle dance."
Hoffecker is the author of "Landscape of the Mind: Human Evolution and the Archaeology of Thought," published by Columbia University Press.
While anatomical fossil evidence for the capability of speech is controversial, the archaeological discoveries of symbols coincides with a creative explosion in the making of many kinds of artifacts. Abstract designs scratched on mineral pigment show up in Africa about 75,000 years ago and are widely accepted by archaeologists as evidence for symbolism and language. "From this point onward there is a growing variety of new types of artifacts that indicates a thoroughly modern capacity for novelty and invention."
The roots of the mind and the super-brain lie deep in our past and are likely tied to fundamental aspects of our evolution like bipedalism and making stone tools, he said. It was from the making of tools that early humans first developed their ability to project complex thoughts or mental representations outside the individual brain -- our own version of the honeybee waggle dance, Hoffecker said.
While crude stone tools crafted by human ancestors beginning about 2.5 million years ago likely were an indirect consequence of bipedalism -- which freed up the hands for new functions -- the first inklings of a developing super-brain likely began about 1.6 million years ago when early humans began crafting stone hand axes, thought by Hoffecker and others to be one of the first external representations of internal thought.
Ancient hand axes achieved "exalted status" as mental representations since they bear little resemblance to the natural objects they were made from -- generally cobbles or rock fragments. "They reflect a design or mental template stored in the nerve cells of the brain and imposed on the rock, and they seemed to have emerged from a strong feedback relationship among the hands, eyes, brains and the tools themselves," he said.
The emerging modern mind in Africa was marked by a three-fold increase in brain size over 3-million-year-old human ancestors like Lucy, thought by some to be the matriarch of modern humans. Humans were producing perforated shell ornaments, polished bone awls and simple geometric designs incised into lumps of red ochre by 75,000 years ago. "With the appearance of symbols and language -- and the consequent integration of brains into a super-brain -- the human mind seems to have taken off as a potentially unlimited creative force," he said.
The dispersal of modern humans from Africa to Europe some 50,000 to 60,000 years ago provides a "minimum date" for the development of language, Hoffecker speculated. "Since all languages have basically the same structure, it is inconceivable to me that they could have evolved independently at different times and places."
A 2007 study led by Hoffecker and colleagues at the Russian Academy of Sciences pinpointed the earliest evidence of modern humans in Europe dating back 45,000 years ago. Located on the Don River 250 miles south of Moscow, the multiple sites, collectively known as Kostenki, also yielded ancient bone and ivory needles complete with eyelets, showing the inhabitants tailored furs to survive the harsh winters.
The team also discovered a carved piece of mammoth ivory that appears to be the head of a small figurine dating to more than 40,000 years ago. "If that turns out to be the case, it would be the oldest piece of figurative art ever discovered," said Hoffecker, whose research at Kostenki was funded in part by the National Science Foundation.
The finds from Kostenki illustrate the impact of the creative mind of modern humans as they spread out of Africa into places that were sometimes cold and lean in resources, Hoffecker said. "Fresh from the tropics, they adapted to ice age environments in the central plain of Russia through creative innovations in technology."
Ancient musical instruments and figurative art discovered in caves in France and Germany date to before 30,000 years ago, he said. "Humans have the ability to imagine something in the brain that doesn't exist and then create it," he said. "Whether it's a hand axe, a flute or a Chevrolet, humans are continually recombining bits of information into novel forms, and the variations are potentially infinite."
While the concept of a human super-brain is analogous to social insects like bees and ants that collectively behave as a super-organism by gathering, processing and sharing information about their environment, there is one important difference, Hoffecker said. "Human societies are not super-organisms -- they are composed of people who are for the most part unrelated, and societies filled with competing individuals and families."
Since the emergence of the modern industrial world beginning roughly 500 years ago, creativity driven by the human super-brain has grown by leaps and bounds, from the invention of mechanical clocks to space shuttles. Powerful artificial intelligence could blur the differences between humans and computers in the coming centuries, he said.
In new study released this week, scientists have moved a step closer to understanding genetic changes that permitted humans and other mammals to develop big brains. During evolution, different mammal species have experienced variable degrees of expansion in brain size. The process by which some species evolved larger brains – called encephalization – is not well understood by scientists. The puzzle is made more complex because evolving large brains comes at a very high cost.
Dr Humberto Gutierrez, from the School of Life Sciences, University of Lincoln, UK, led research which examined the genomes of 39 species of mammals with the aim of better understanding how brains became larger and more complex in mammals.
To do this, the scientists focussed on the size of gene families across these species. Gene families are groups of related genes which share similar characteristics, often linked with common or related biological functions. It is believed that large changes in the size of gene families can help to explain why related species evolved along different paths.
The researchers found a clear link between increased brain size and the expansion of gene families related to certain biological functions.
“We found that brain size variations are associated with changes in gene number in a large proportion of families of closely related genes," said Dr Gutierrez. "These gene families are preferentially involved in cell communication and cell movement as well as immune functions and are prominently expressed in the human brain. Our results suggest that changes in gene family size may have contributed to the evolution of larger brains in mammals.”
Mammalian species in general tend to have large brains compared to their body size which represent an evolutionary costly adaptation as they require large amounts of energy to function.
“The brain is an extremely expensive organ consuming a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals," Gutierrez explained. "Larger brains also demand higher parental investment. For example, humans require many years of nurturing and care before their brains are fully matured.”
Dr Gutierrez’s research concluded that variations in the size of gene families associated with encephalization provided an evolutionary support for the specific physiological demands associated with increased brain size in mammals.
The research paper ‘Increased brain size in mammals is associated with size variations in gene families with cell signalling, chemotaxis and immune-related functions’ is published in Proceedings of the Royal Society.

New observations from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope show that starbursts in dwarf galaxies played a bigger role than expected in the early history of the Universe. Although galaxies across the Universe are still forming new stars, the majority of the stars were formed between two and six billion years after the Big Bang. Studying this early epoch of the Universe’s history is key in order to fully understand how these stars formed, and how galaxies have grown and evolved since.
A new study using data from Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) has allowed astronomers to take a new step forward in understanding this crucial era by peering at a sample of dwarf galaxies in the early Universe and, in particular, a selection of starburst galaxies within this sample. These starburst galaxies form stars at a furiously fast rate, far above the “normal” star formation rate expected of galaxies. Previous studies of starburst galaxies have focussed on analysing mid-range or high-mass galaxies, leaving out the huge number of dwarf galaxies that existed in this era of prolific star formation.
It was not previously possible to study these distant small galaxies closely. Astronomers could only observe small galaxies at smaller distances or larger galaxies at greater distances. The highly sensitive infrared capabilities of WFC3 and its unique grism spectroscopy mode have now allowed astronomers to peer at low-mass dwarf galaxies in the distant Universe and to deduce the contribution of the starburst galaxies to the total star formation within dwarf galaxies at that time.
The grism splits up the light from the galaxies, revealing the distribution of brightness and color in the Universe. This allows scientists to deduce facts about their chemical composition and distance from Earth that would not be possible without such a detailed view from Hubble’s space-based perspective.
“We already suspected that dwarf starbursting galaxies would contribute to the early wave of star formation, but this is the first time we’ve been able to measure the effect they actually had,” says Hakim Atek of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, lead author of the new paper. “They appear to have had a surprisingly significant role to play during the epoch where the Universe formed most of its stars.”
“These galaxies are forming stars so quickly that they could actually double their entire mass of stars in only 150 million years — this sort of gain in stellar mass would take most normal galaxies 1-3 billion years,” adds co-author Jean-Paul Kneib, also of EPFL.
This result contributes to a decade-long investigation to understand the links between galaxies’ mass and their star-forming activity, and helps to paint a consistent picture of events in the early Universe.
As well as adding new insight into how and where the stars in our Universe formed, this new finding will certainly help to unravel the secrets of galactic evolution. It is unusual to find a galaxy in a state of starburst, implying that they are the result of some strange incident, such as a merger, a tidal interaction with another galaxy, or the shockwave from a supernova. By studying these galaxies more closely and understanding how they formed and behaved in their earliest years, astronomers hope to discover the cause of these violent bursts and learn more about galactic evolution throughout the Universe.
A paper based on this research will be published online in The Astrophysical Journal on 19 June 2014.
