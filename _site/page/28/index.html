  <p>(Hiroshima University) Researchers in Japan and China identified the requirements for the development of new types of extremely low power consumption electric devices by studying thin films made of Cr-doped (Sb, Bi)2Te3. At extremely low temperatures, an electric current flows around the edge of the film without energy loss owing to ferromagnetism. The research group proved that the atoms of non-magnetic elements such as Sb atoms and Te atoms are key to the material’s ferromagnetism.</p>

  <p>Scientists and engineers gathered together to figure out what would make a good Martian landing site and what hurdles they’ll have to overcome for a 2035 launch.
NASA
Pack the toothpaste, kids, we’re going to Mars.
. . . and the mining equipment, the spacesuits, and the fertilizer, not to mention the two decades of research and development it’ll take to get us there.
But NASA and a whole lot of other dreamers (who have labs and PhDs to back them up) are determined that, as Yoda would put it, get there we will.
To start the ball rolling, dozens of scientists and engineers met this fall to hash out what they’ll need in order to successfully establish a human presence on Mars. This endeavor isn’t like the rover missions, where we pick an interesting site, plop down a robot, and roll from one curiosity to the next. Instead, workshop attendees were evaluating what NASA organizers called the exploration zone concept — in essence, a field station.
To make the most of a human presence on Mars, NASA envisions setting up an exploration zone, or EZ. The EZ would be roughly 100 km in radius (not yet accounting for ups and downs in the geography). In its boundary will lie several mining sites, called In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) regions of interest (ROIs), as well as sites of scientific interest that astronauts would explore. Shown here is a rough schematic of what an EZ might look like. NASA
As presented at the workshop, here’s a rough cut of what a crewed mission to the Martian surface would look like: a four-person crew would set up shop in an exploration zone roughly 100 km (60 miles) in radius. In that zone would be various things of scientific interest. The astronauts would also have a habitat, resource mining equipment, and a couple of pressurized rovers, able to go on adventures lasting maybe 10 to 15 sols (Martian days). Due to how the orbital mechanics work out, the crew would spend 300 to 500 days on the planet. Between two and five crews — and, due to the investment involved, probably the higher end of that range — would, one after the other, use the same exploration zone as home base, building up its infrastructure over time.
Some asked, why a single landing site? Why not drop each crew somewhere new? The problem is, it takes a whole lot of resources to support a crew. They’re going to have to produce their own air, food, and fuel. Air, because Mars’s thin atmosphere is 96% carbon dioxide. Food, because packaged food loses its nutritional value after a couple of years, and we don’t want pioneers depending on a nutritionless stockpile. Fuel, because two-thirds of the mass of a four-person vehicle launching from the Red Planet’s surface will be propellant. Mission planners would rather not have to bring all that mass from Earth. Instead, the goal is to manufacture the propellant needed for all five crews’ departures right on site.
Investing in one location will give humans a foothold in the most unforgiving landscape we’ve ever explored. The model NASA planners are following is the successful, albeit slow, buildup of human presence in Antarctica: a half century passed between the first expedition hut and McMurdo Station, but since then McMurdo has been a hub of scientific research on the frozen continent. NASA doesn’t just want to go to Mars, plant a flag, and go home. It wants to go and stay there.
Water on Mars

This level of commitment means that we have to think hard about resources, the feasibility of mining and using them, and finding (and plugging) the holes in our knowledge. The No. 1 requirement for an exploration zone is water. That might sound silly, given we’re talking about a desiccated planet. But we do know that water exists there, trapped in minerals and subsurface ice. We just don’t know exactly how much there is or how to harvest it.
Water will be crucial for astronauts, and not merely for drinking and watering plants. Water serves as a spacesuit coolant and for radiation protection, and — perhaps most importantly — it’s the base ingredient crews will need for manufacturing the propellant to fuel their departures. It’ll take roughly 20,000 kg of water to launch from the Red Planet’s surface, and that’s just for one, four-person crew. If we’re going to send five crews to the same site, we’ll need something like 100 metric tons of water.
That’s a lot of water.
At the moment, we don’t know how deep the deposits of sheet ice and hydrated minerals go; previous missions didn’t have the ability to find out. To answer this question, we’ll need the right kind of radar on an orbiter, and maybe additional groundwork, too, says Richard Davis, assistant director for science and exploration in NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. Plus, the workhorse surface imager, NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, is a decade old and starting to show its age. We need to replace it.
The Dirty Details of Exploration
NASA’s Curiosity rover took this enhanced-color view from the “Kimberley” formation on Mars. The colors are adjusted so that rocks look approximately as they would if they were on Earth, to help geologists interpret what they’re seeing. (This adjustment overly compensates for the absence of blue on Mars, making the sky appear light blue and sometimes giving dark, black rocks a blue cast.) The strata in the foreground dip towards the base of Aeolis Mons (also called Mount Sharp). Scientists think the dip indicates water flowed toward a basin that existed before the larger bulk of the mountain formed. Gale Crater, which lies near the planet’s equator, is one of more than 40 sites considered as a starting point at the recent Humans to Mars workshop.NASA / JPL-Caltech / MSSS
Other issues also became clear during the workshop. For starters, we might need to land near the planet’s equator. High-latitude sites experience larger seasonal temperature variations, and it takes a lot of energy to keep equipment (not to mention people) warm when temperatures plummet on the Red Planet.
Then there are the realities of mining. How much water and metals are we really going to be able to harvest, and will they be worth the energy and effort it takes to obtain them? Robin Fergason (USGS) and others pointed out that we don’t even agree on how big a dust grain is. That sounds esoteric, but if we don’t know whether we’re trying to separate an 80-micron particle or a 5-micron particle from ore, can we design the right equipment for the job? The hard truths of “resource acquisition” will potentially be the focus of the next workshop in a couple of years.
The work left to be done is, frankly, daunting. And there’s no time to lose. From gathering more surface images for vetting sites to devising long-lasting hardware, scientists and engineers are going to be busy. Plus, they’re going to need to make sure they’re not talking past each other, because a mission “essential” to a scientist might be a mission “impossible” for an engineer.
But there is hope. “Human Mars missions have always been 20 years in the future,” Steve Hoffman (NASA Johnson Space Center) said at the workshop. “But this group is here now talking about, in all seriousness, where we’re going to send people. That has not happened before.”
Below, you’ll find a map of all the potential exploration zones discussed at the workshop (the signatures are from the attendees) — but remember, this conference wasn’t about picking a site so much as hashing out why various sites would be good or bad. You can also watch recordings from all the workshop presentations on the Lunar and Planetary Institute’s YouTube channel.

China's space science efforts got a boost today with the launch of the first of four planned scientific missions. The Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) rode into space on a Long March 2D rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi desert, about 1600 kilometers west of Beijing, at about 8:12 a.m. local time.
"This is an exciting mission," says theoretical astrophysicist David Spergel of Princeton University. If dark matter annihilates, as some theories predict, "DAMPE has an opportunity to detect dark matter annihilation products," Spergel says. The launch also marks China’s new commitment to scientific space missions. "DAMPE is the first Chinese space mission for astronomy and astrophysics," says Yizhong Fan, an astrophysicist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences's (CAS's) Purple Mountain Observatory in Nanjing who is one of the mission scientists.
Dark matter is believed to make up most of the matter in the universe. But it has never been detected directly; its existence is inferred from observed gravitational effects on visible matter and the structure of the universe. DAMPE is designed to observe the incoming direction, energy, and electric charge of extremely high-energy photons and electrons that result when dark matter candidate particles called weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) annihilate. The satellite's payload is made up of a stack of thin criss-crossed strip detectors tuned to catch signals created by photons and electrons as well as gamma rays and cosmic rays.
"We are, of course, confident that DAMPE will contribute to the dark matter search," says Philipp Azzarello, a University of Geneva in Switzerland astrophysicist who collaborated in the design of DAMPE’s detector. Azzarello says the satellite improves on the energy range and resolution of previous space-based dark matter experiments. "The project is starting at an exciting time of intense searches for dark matter," agrees Vitaly Kudryavtsev, a particle physicist at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom who is also searching for dark matter. He says DAMPE will complement other space-based detectors as well as underground laboratories seeking to detect WIMPs directly.
The DAMPE collaboration comprises four institutes under CAS, including the National Space Science Center in Beijing; also involved are the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, the University of Geneva, and Italian universities in Bari, Lecce, and Perugia. The satellite has been named Wukong, after the Monkey King character in the 16th century Chinese novel Journey to the West. It will enter a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 500 kilometers. Fan says everything is going as planned but that it will take several days to confirm that all systems are working properly. Calibration of the DAMPE detector will then take about 2 months. "Scientific observations may start in February 2016," Fan says.
DAMPE is the first of four purely scientific satellites that add a new dimension to China's space efforts, which until now were strongly focused on engineering and applications. The Chang’e-3 lunar lander, launched in December 2013, investigated the moon’s surface topography and soil composition. And there were two previous scientific missions: the Geospace Double Star Exploration Program, developed with the European Space Agency and launched in 2004 to study Earth's magnetosphere; and a Mars probe, Yinghuo-1, launched on a Russian rocket in 2011, that failed to exit an Earth orbit.
But CAS’s 2011 Strategic Pioneer Program on Space Science has put research missions on a firmer footing. They are being managed by CAS's National Space Science Center (NSSC), which hopes to launch three more missions in 2016. One is the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope to observe black holes, neutron stars, and other astronomical phenomena.
NSSC and other CAS institutes are also working on a microgravity and life science research mission, dubbed Shijian-10, that features a re-entry capsule to return some of the experiments to Earth for analysis. There is also a satellite for quantum science experiments in the works. NSSC has set up a new mission control center for scientific satellites in Huairou, a northern suburb of Beijing.
"For sure, more [scientific missions] are to come," says Azzarello, who adds that he is looking forward to future opportunities to collaborate with China's growing space science program.

<p>Galaxy 1068 can be seen in close-up in this view from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. NuSTAR’s high-energy X-rays eyes were able to obtain the best view yet into the hidden lair of the galaxy NGC 1068’s central, supermassive black hole, located 47 million light-years away in the Cetus constellation. New research has revealed that the thick donut-shaped disks of gas and dust that surround most massive black holes in the universe are ‘clumpy’ rather than smooth as originally thought.
Until recently, telescopes weren’t able to penetrate some of these donuts, also known as tori, which feed and nourish the growing black holes tucked inside.
The Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society study, which was co-authored by Dr Poshak Gandhi of the University of Southampton, described results from NASA’s Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and the European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton space observatory.
The observations revealed that the rotating material is not a simple, rounded donut but more like defective, lumpy donuts that a donut shop might throw away.
The new discovery is the first time that this clumpiness has been observed in an ultra-thick donut, and supports the idea that this phenomenon may be common. The research is important for understanding the growth and evolution of massive black holes and their host galaxies.
Donuts around supermassive black holes were first proposed in the mid-1980s to explain why some black holes are hidden behind gas and dust, while others are not. The idea is that the orientation of the donut relative to Earth affects the way we perceive a black hole and its intense radiation. If the donut is viewed edge-on, the black hole is blocked. If the donut is viewed face-on, the black hole and its surrounding, blazing materials can be detected. This idea is referred to as the unified model because it neatly joins together the different black hole types, based solely upon orientation.
“We don’t fully understand why some supermassive black holes are so heavily obscured, or why the surrounding material is clumpy,” said Dr Gandhi. “This is a subject of hot research.”
NGC 1068 is well known to astronomers as the first black hole to give birth to the unification idea. “But it is only with NuSTAR that we now have a direct glimpse of its black hole through such clouds, albeit fleeting, allowing a better test of the unification concept,” said Andrea Marinucci of the Roma Tre University in Italy and lead author of the study.
The team says that future research will address the question of what causes the unevenness in tori. It’s possible that a black hole generates turbulence as it chomps on nearby material. Or, the energy given off by young stars could also stir up turbulence, which would then percolate outward through the donut. Another possibility is that, the clumps may be from material that falls onto the donut from outside it. As galaxies form, material migrates toward the centre, where the density and gravity is greatest. The material tends to fall in clumps, almost like a falling stream of water condensing into droplets as it hits the ground.
“We’d like to figure out if the unevenness of the material is being generated from outside the donut, or within it,” said Professor Gandhi.
“These coordinated observations with NuSTAR and XMM-Newton show yet again the exciting science possible when these satellites work together,” said Daniel Stern, the project scientist for NuSTAR at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

  <p>The recently launched Dark Matter Particle Explorer takes the hunt to space.
The Thursday morning launch of DAMPE.  Xinhua / China News Agency
A Long March 2D rocket lit up the dawn skies over the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China on the morning of December 17th as it sent the nation’s first astrophysics payload into orbit. The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) will probe gaps in our understanding of high-energy astrophysics — and it just might detect signatures of elusive dark matter.
The DAMPE mission, nicknamed Wukong after the supernatural Monkey King in a 16th-century Chinese novel, is the result of a collaboration between universities in Switzerland, Italy, and the China Academy of Sciences. (NASA is restricted from trading technology with China due to the International Trade in Arms Regulations enacted in 1976, which is one of the main reasons China isn’t a partner on the International Space Station, but European countries have no such restriction.)

Once DAMPE reaches low-Earth orbit, high above our protective atmosphere, it will begin detecting energetic particles known as cosmic rays as well as gamma-ray photons from supernovae, pulsars, and other astrophysical sources. And it’s possible that certain types of dark matter could produce an observable signal too.
DAMPE joins the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) and the Calorimetric Electron Telescope aboard the International Space Station in taking the dark matter hunt to space. But DAMPE will extend the search to higher-energy regimes, detecting particles and photons in the tera-electronvolt (TeV) range, similar to the particles produced in groundbased particle colliders such as CERN. The high-energy reach is a first for a space mission.
DAMPE uses a stack of detectors known as scintillators, each comprised of material that flashes when struck by the ionizing radiation from a high-energy particle. DAMPE has the most sensitive detector of its kind ever fielded in space, allowing it to detect these flashes and gauge their energy and direction of origin with unprecedented precision.
“If we are fortunate, [DAMPE] could discover dark matter,” says theoretical astrophysicist David Spergel (Princeton University). “It is certain to teach us more about cosmic rays.”
Probing the Highest Energies

The hunt for dark matter is at the forefront of modern astrophysics: multiple lines of evidence, such as tracing the motion of galaxies within the famous Bullet Cluster, tell us we can’t see the majority of the universe’s mass. Moreover, dark matter can’t be made of ordinary particles — to replicate the universe’s evolution in simulations, dark matter must be a new, exotic type of particle.
One leading prospect — known as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) — acts as its own anti-particle. In places that should be swarming with dark matter, such as our galaxy’s center or nearby dwarf galaxies, WIMP particles ought to be colliding with each other in great numbers. Their annihilation would produce a special signature at high energies, hints of which have already been spotted by the AMS. Like the AMS, DAMPE will be identifying the by-products of these collisions rather than seeing WIMPs themselves but the higher energies it detects would enable it to pin down the particles’ mass.
A little closer to home, DAMPE will also be characterizing the high-energy environment around Earth. Long-term exposure to high-energy radiation is a real threat to astronauts on a mission to Mars, such as the one NASA is planning for the 2030s, and scientists must understand it before attempting any such mission.
Congratulations to China on deploying its first astrophysics mission to space. This is the first of a five-mission series, with two additional science payloads set to launch in 2016.

A distant galaxy shining with the light of more than 300 trillion suns was discovered this past May using data from NASA’s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The galaxy is the most luminous galaxy found to date and belongs to a new class of objects recently discovered by WISE – extremely luminous infrared galaxies, or ELIRGs. The brilliant galaxy, known as WISE J224607.57-052635.0, may have a behemoth black hole at its belly, gorging itself on gas.
Immense black holes are common at the cores of galaxies, but finding one this big so “far back” in the cosmos is rare. Because light from the galaxy hosting the black hole has traveled 12.5 billion years to reach us, astronomers are seeing the object as it was in the distant past. The black hole was already billions of times the mass of our sun when our universe was only a tenth of its present age of 13.8 billion years.
The new study outlines three reasons why the black holes in the ELIRGs could have grown so massive. First, they may have been born big. In other words, the “seeds,” or embryonic black holes, might be bigger than thought possible.
“How do you get an elephant?” asked Peter Eisenhardt, project scientist for WISE at JPL and a co-author on the paper. “One way is start with a baby elephant.”
The other two explanations involve either breaking or bending the theoretical limit of black hole feeding, called the Eddington limit. When a black hole feeds, gas falls in and heats up, blasting out light. The pressure of the light actually pushes the gas away, creating a limit to how fast the black hole can continuously scarf down matter. If a black hole broke this limit, it could theoretically balloon in size at a breakneck pace. Black holes have previously been observed breaking this limit; however, the black hole in the study would have had to repeatedly break the limit to grow this large. Alternatively, the black holes might just be bending this limit.
“Another way for a black hole to grow this big is for it to have gone on a sustained binge, consuming food faster than typically thought possible,” said Tsai. “This can happen if the black hole isn’t spinning that fast.”
If a black hole spins slowly enough, it won’t repel its meal as much. In the end, a slow-spinning black hole can gobble up more matter than a fast spinner.
“The massive black holes in ELIRGs could be gorging themselves on more matter for a longer period of time,” said Andrew Blain of University of Leicester in the United Kingdom, a co-author of this report. “It’s like winning a hot-dog-eating contest lasting hundreds of millions of years.”
More research is needed to solve this puzzle of these dazzlingly luminous galaxies. The team has plans to better determine the masses of the central black holes. Knowing these objects’ true hefts will help reveal their history, as well as that of other galaxies, in this very crucial and frenzied chapter of our cosmos.
WISE has been finding more of these oddball galaxies in infrared images of the entire sky captured in 2010. By viewing the whole sky with more sensitivity than ever before, WISE has been able to catch rare cosmic specimens that might have been missed otherwise.
The new study reports a total of 20 new ELIRGs, including the most luminous galaxy found to date. These galaxies were not found earlier because of their distance, and because dust converts their powerful visible light into an incredible outpouring of infrared light.
“We found in a related study with WISE that as many as half of the most luminous galaxies only show up well in infrared light,” said Tsai.
JPL manages and operates WISE for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The spacecraft was put into hibernation mode in 2011, after it scanned the entire sky twice, thereby completing its main objectives. In September 2013, WISE was reactivated, renamed NEOWISE and assigned a new mission to assist NASA’s efforts to identify potentially hazardous near-Earth objects.

"It is quite surprising that gravity can play any role in quantum mechanics", says Igor Pikovski, a theoretical physicist working at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics:"Gravity is usually studied on astronomical scales, but it seems that it also alters the quantum nature of the smallest particles on Earth". "It remains to be seen what the results imply on cosmological scales, where gravity can be much stronger", adds Caslav Brukner University Professor at the University of Vienna and Director of the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information.
In 1915 Albert Einstein formulated the theory of general relativity which fundamentally changed our understanding of gravity. He explained gravity as the manifestation of the curvature of space and time. Einstein's theory predicts that the flow of time is altered by mass. This effect, known as "gravitational time dilation", causes time to be slowed down near a massive object. It affects everything and everybody; in fact, people working on the ground floor will age slower than their colleagues a floor above, by about 10 nanoseconds in one year. This tiny effect has actually been confirmed in many experiments with very precise clocks.
This past June, a team of researchers from the University of Vienna, Harvard University and the University of Queensland discovered that the slowing down of time can explain another perplexing phenomenon: the transition from quantum behavior to our classical, everyday world.
The image below is an illustration of a molecule in the presence of gravitational time dilation. The molecule is in a quantum superposition of being several places at the same time.
 

 
Quantum theory, the other major discovery in physics in the early 20th century, predicts that the fundamental building blocks of nature show fascinating and mind-boggling behavior. Extrapolated to the scales of our everyday life quantum theory leads to situations such as the famous example of Schroedinger's cat: the cat is neither dead nor alive, but in a so-called quantum superposition of both. Yet such a behavior has only been confirmed experimentally with small particles and has never been observed with real-world cats. Therefore, scientists conclude that something must cause the suppression of quantum phenomena on larger, everyday scales. Typically this happens because of interaction with other surrounding particles.
The research team, headed by ?aslav Brukner from the University of Vienna and the Institute of Quantum Optics and Quantum Information, found that time dilation also plays a major role in the demise of quantum effects. They calculated that once the small building blocks form larger, composite objects - such as molecules and eventually larger structures like microbes or dust particles -, the time dilation on Earth can cause a suppression of their quantum behavior.
The tiny building blocks jitter ever so slightly, even as they form larger objects. And this jitter is affected by time dilation: it is slowed down on the ground and speeds up at higher altitudes. The researchers have shown that this effect destroys the quantum superposition and, thus, forces larger objects to behave as we expect in everyday life.
The results of Pikovski and his co-workers reveal how larger particles lose their quantum behavior due to their own composition, if one takes time dilation into account. This prediction should be observable in experiments in the near future, which could shed some light on the fascinating interplay between the two great theories of the 20th century, quantum theory and general relativity.

  <p>“It seizes points in common, between subjects having no very apparent connexion, &amp; hence seldom or never brought into juxtaposition.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The human imagination is the seedbed of everything we know to be beautiful and true — it created the Mona Lisa’s smile and recreates its mystery anew with each viewing; it envisioned the existence of a strange particle and sparked the myriad scientific breakthroughs that made its discovery possible half a century later in the Higgs boson; it allows us to perform the psychoemotional acrobatics at the heart of compassion as we imagine ourselves in another’s shoes. And yet the essence of the imagination remains elusive and opaque even to those most endowed with this miraculous human faculty. 
Perhaps the finest definition of what it is and how it works comes from Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, better known as Ada Lovelace (December 10, 1815–November 27, 1852), who is commonly considered the world’s first computer programmer for her collaboration with Charles Babbage on the first computer.
Illustration by Sydney Padua from The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage
In early January of 1841, two years before she applied her formidable imagination to writing the first paper on computer science and forever changing the course of technology, Lovelace considered the nature of the imagination and its three core faculties in a magnificent letter found in Ada, the Enchantress of Numbers: A Selection from the Letters of Lord Byron’s Daughter and Her Description of the First Computer (public library) — the same volume that gave us Lovelace on science and religion.
A century and a half before Stephen Jay Gould observed that creativity is the art of connecting the seemingly unrelated, she writes:
What is Imagination? We talk much of Imagination. We talk of Imagination of Poets, the Imagination of Artists &#038;c; I am inclined to think that in general we don’t know very exactly what we are talking about. Imagination I think especially two fold.
First: it is the Combining Faculty. It brings together things, facts, ideas, conceptions, in new, original, endless, ever varying, Combinations. It seizes points in common, between subjects having no very apparent connexion, &#038; hence seldom or never brought into juxtaposition.
Secondly: It conceives &#038; brings into mental presences that which is far away, or invisible, or which in short does not exist within our physical &#038; conscious cognizance. Hence is it especially the religious faculty; the ground-work of Faith. It is a God-like, a noble faculty. It renders earth tolerable (at least should do so); it teaches us to live, in the tone of the eternal.
Imagination is the Discovering Faculty, pre-eminently. It is that which penetrates into the unseen worlds around us, the worlds of Science. It is that which feels &#038; discovers what is, the real which we see not, which exists not for our senses. Those who have learned to walk on the threshold of the unknown worlds, by means of what are commonly termed par excellence the exact sciences, may then with the fair white wings of Imagination hope to soar further into the unexplored amidst which we live.
She points to mathematics as a supreme manifestation of these two imaginative faculties:
Mathematical Science shows what is. It is the language of the unseen relations between things. But to use &#038; apply that language we must be able fully to appreciate, to feel, to seize, the unseen, the unconscious. Imagination too shows what is, the is that is beyond the senses. Hence she is or should be especially cultivated by the truly Scientific, — those who wish to enter into the worlds around us!
Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (Portrait by Alfred Edward Chalon, 1840)
Complement the altogether revelatory Ada, the Enchantress of Numbers with the illustrated story of how Lovelace and Babbage invented the world’s first computer, Sartre on the key to the imagination, and this wonderful 1957 read on the role of intuition in scientific discovery.
