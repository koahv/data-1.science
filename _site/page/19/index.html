  <p>A recently discovered asteroid plays leapfrog with Earth as they both orbit around the Sun.

Our fair planet has a tiny companion, an asteroid that shares our annual journey around the Sun in a complex dance.
Astronomers recently announced the discovery of 2016 HO3, an asteroid between 40 and 100 meters in size that behaves as Earth’s quasi-satellite. Discovered as a 24th-magnitude blip on April 27, 2016, by the Pan-STARRS 1 survey based on Haleakala, Hawai’i, 2016 HO3 occupies an orbit very much like Earth’s. Calculations suggest that, though it evaded detection until this year, 2016 HO3 has hung out in Earth’s vicinity for a century or so, and will continue to play orbital leapfrog with our world for centuries to come.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2016 HO3’s Weird Orbit
“Since 2016 HO3 loops around our planet, but never ventures very far away as we go around the Sun, we refer to it as a quasi-satellite of Earth,” says Paul Chodas (NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory). “In effect, this small asteroid is caught in a little dance with Earth.”
2016 HO3’s orbit takes it alternately sunward and ahead of Earth for six months at a time, then it’s slightly farther from the Sun and falls behind us. Its orbit is slightly tilted relative to the ecliptic plane, resulting in a corkscrew twist in the orbit over several decades. Too distant to be considered a true second moon, 2016 HO3’s journey takes it as close as 38 times the Earth-Moon distance (9.1 million miles or 0.1 astronomical unit) from our planet, and as far as 100 times the Earth-Moon distance (24 million miles or 0.25 astronomical unit).
Chodas explains that this body doesn’t qualify as a “minimoon” of Earth because our planet’s gravity is simply too weak to truly capture it. “One easy way to distinguish a captured object from a quasi-satellite is the period of the loop about our planet,” he explains. “Captured objects are true satellites of Earth and will loop around with periods as large as a few months, much less than 1 year. Quasi-satellites loop around Earth with periods of almost exactly 1 year.”
As an Apollo asteroid, 2016 HO3 joins the small but growing list of objects tracked in a solar orbit near Earth. Asteroid 2003 YN107 was discovered by the LINEAR sky survey about a decade ago, when it followed a similar track, but the rock has since departed our neighborhood. Asteroid 2006 RH120 — the only true minimoon yet discovered — made several distant looping passes of Earth from April 2006 to September 2007 before ejection. It turns out that our Moon does a pretty good job at celestial goaltending, assuring such secondary hopefuls never hang around for long.
Simulations carried out by Mikael Granvik (University of Helsinki, Finland) in 2012 suggest that most “Temporarily Captured Objects” (TCOs) only complete three orbits of the Earth-Moon system before ejection, and only 1% ever impact Earth. (Read Sky &amp; Telescope’s September 2015 issue for more info.)
Claims for a tiny, second moon around Earth, dubbed “Lilith,” go all the way back to alleged sightings in the 19th century. “Petit’s Moon” created a temporary sensation in 1846, until it too proved to be spurious. In modern times, spent boosters from the China’s Chang’e 2 and NASA’s Apollo 12 lunar missions were temporarily identified as “asteroids” 2010 QW1 and J002E3, respectively. Other objects, such as 3753 Cruithne occupy strange horseshoe-shaped orbits around Earth. Venus also has its own quasi-satellite, designated 2002 VE68.
Hunting Temporary Minimoons
A new generation of all sky surveys could swell the ranks of known TCOs. The enormously successful PanSTARRS project, which currently operates with just one of four proposed telescopes, might one day get its full complement for such a dedicated search. A 2014 study suggests that the Subaru telescope could stand a 90% chance of nabbing a potential TCO after only 5 nights of dedicated scanning of the sky. Then there’s the Large Synoptic Sky Survey, (LSST) set to see first light in 2022 — they’re working on the primary mirrors now (watch the video below).</p>

<p>The discovery of 2016 HO3 spawns far more questions than it answers: Where did it come from? Did the rock spall off the Moon during an impact, or is it merely an asteroid that wandered too close to Earth? Could 2016 HO3 make the candidate list of possible targets for a future crewed mission to an asteroid? Future discoveries will help put 2016 HO3 into context and help reveal its origin.

<p>New images obtained on May 16, 2016, by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope confirm the presence of a dark vortex in the atmosphere of Neptune. Though similar features were seen during the Voyager 2 flyby of Neptune in 1989 and by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1994, this vortex is the first one observed on Neptune in the 21st century.
The discovery was announced on May 17, 2016, in a Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams (CBAT) electronic telegram by University of California at Berkeley research astronomer Mike Wong, who led the team that analyzed the Hubble data.
Neptune’s dark vortices are high-pressure systems and are usually accompanied by bright “companion clouds,” which are also now visible on the distant planet. The bright clouds form when the flow of ambient air is perturbed and diverted upward over the dark vortex, causing gases to likely freeze into methane ice crystals. “Dark vortices coast through the atmosphere like huge, lens-shaped gaseous mountains,” Wong said. “And the companion clouds are similar to so-called orographic clouds that appear as pancake-shaped features lingering over mountains on Earth.”
Beginning in July 2015, bright clouds were again seen on Neptune by several observers, from amateurs to astronomers at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Astronomers suspected that these clouds might be bright companion clouds following an unseen dark vortex. Neptune’s dark vortices are typically only seen at blue wavelengths, and only Hubble has the high resolution required for seeing them on distant Neptune.
In September 2015, the Outer Planet Atmospheres Legacy (OPAL) program, a long-term Hubble Space Telescope project that annually captures global maps of the outer planets, revealed a dark spot close to the location of the bright clouds, which had been tracked from the ground. By viewing the vortex a second time, the new Hubble images confirm that OPAL really detected a long-lived feature. The new data enabled the team to create a higher-quality map of the vortex and its surroundings.
Neptune’s dark vortices have exhibited surprising diversity over the years, in terms of size, shape, and stability (they meander in latitude, and sometimes speed up or slow down). They also come and go on much shorter timescales compared to similar anticyclones seen on Jupiter; large storms on Jupiter evolve over decades.
Planetary astronomers hope to better understand how dark vortices originate, what controls their drifts and oscillations, how they interact with the environment, and how they eventually dissipate, according to UC Berkeley doctoral student Joshua Tollefson, who was recently awarded a prestigious NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship to study Neptune’s atmosphere. Measuring the evolution of the new dark vortex will extend knowledge of both the dark vortices themselves, as well as the structure and dynamics of the surrounding atmosphere.
The team, led by Wong, also included the OPAL team (Wong, Amy Simon, and Glenn Orton), UC Berkeley collaborators (Imke de Pater, Joshua Tollefson, and Katherine de Kleer), Heidi Hammel (AURA), Statia Luszcz-Cook (AMNH), Ricardo Hueso and Agustin Sánchez-Lavega (Universidad del Pais Vasco), Marc Delcroix (Société Astronomique de France), Larry Sromovsky and Patrick Fry (University of Wisconsin), and Christoph Baranec (University of Hawaii).

  <p>At TED2014, Curator Chris Anderson spoke to whistleblower Edward Snowden through a telepresence robot. Photo: Ryan Lash
In 2006, TED started putting talks online for free, a milestone in democratizing ideas worth spreading. Since then, the world has seen monumental shifts in history, including the rise and fall of revolutions, the roar of a deadly epidemic, the largest-ever leak of government secrets, an astronomical discovery predicted by Einstein and the election of the first African-American president in the US, to name a few.
To celebrate TED’s 10th anniversary, we’ve collected this playlist of talks that have intersected with history, providing insight on the significant events of their time. Read below for highlights:
Inside the Arab Spring: In December 2010, a man in Tunisia had his cart seized by the police; in protest of the general economic upheaval around him, he set himself on fire. This defiant act ignited the Arab Spring, a series of democratic uprisings and government overthrows across the Arab world. In January 2011, an Egyptian man set himself on fire in protest outside a parliament building in Cairo. The following wave of demonstrations and protests resulted in President Mubarak’s resignation and much later, a draft for a new constitution.
At TED2011, Internet activist and computer engineer Wael Ghonim spoke about his pivotal role in Egypt’s revolution: creating a Facebook page that circumvented censorship and brought new life to a burgeoning movement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The whistleblower — and the whistleblowee: Edward Snowden was a government contractor working in Hawaii for the NSA. But in December 2012, he copied documents from the NSA that detailed government surveillance programs — some on ordinary citizens. With a whistle blow heard around the world, Snowden catalyzed one of the biggest leaks of government secrets in history, and touched off on ongoing conversation about our digital right to privacy.
At TED2014, speaking from a telepresence robot, Edward Snowden gave the audience a nuanced perspective on Internet freedoms and data privacy.</p>

<p>After this surprise talk, Curator Chris Anderson said, “If the NSA wants to respond, please do,” signaling a video response two days later from NSA Deputy Director Richard Ledgett.</p>

<p>Where corruption hides its money: Offshore accounts where the powerful, rich and famous stash millions in cash may sound like antics of the wealthy. But it turns out that leaving such assets untaxed means governments worldwide have to cut corners on crucial public services, such as education and food relief.  Such activities remained well-known but closeted facts until April 3, 2016, when, in the largest data leak in history, documents naming international government leaders, corporations and private citizens alike were leaked from the Panamanian bank Mossack Fonseca. 
In the midst of the scandal, Robert Palmer gave vital context on the Panama Papers straight from the Global Witness headquarters in a direct-to-camera TED Talk.</p>

<p>The terrorist organization ISIS split from Al Qaeda over stark ideological differences and has since concentrated its effort into establishing a worldwide caliphate. Using shock and violence, ISIS attacks range from guerilla-style to large-scale bombings in countries such as Syria, Iraq, France, Belgium, among others.
At TED2015, international policy analyst Benedetta Berti shared with the audience the surprising ways groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas and ISIS maintain local clout in occupied territories: providing social goods, such as schools and hospitals, that are often neglected by governments.</p>

<p>The refugee crisis begins: In the midst of the Arab Spring, a group of Syrian pro-democracy demonstrators protested in March 2011. Security forces opened fire on them, killing several. What followed was a series of demonstrations calling for President Bashar al-Assad, who has been in power since 2000, to resign. This kickstarted a brutal five-year civil war that has, according to UNHCR, so far resulted in more than 4 million Syrian refugees.
At TEDGlobal&gt;Geneva in 2015, former UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres sat down with Bruno Giussani, TED’s European Director, in a Q&amp;A to discuss the complexities of today’s refugee crisis. Guterres suggested that with improved screening, shelter and distribution at entry points, Europe can learn to better welcome refugees, achieving both its humanitarian and practical goals.</p>

<p>And at TED2016, scholar Alexander Betts offered fresh insight on the refugee crisis by addressing how to help refugees contribute and feel a part of their new homes, benefiting both the refugees and their host countries.</p>

<p>Should this physics discovery worry us? On July 4, 2012, scientists at CERN discovered the Higgs boson particle. This marked a monumental achievement in physics. At TEDxCERN, theoretical physicist Gian Giudice posed a worrisome question: Could a Higgs field, in an ultra-dense state, collapse all atomic matter?</p>

<p>The fight against Ebola: Although the virus first appeared in 1976, a new Ebola outbreak became a large-scale epidemic in 2014, ravaging West Africa. With an average 50 percent fatality rate, communities were crippled by the virus and over 11,000 people died, causing devastation and panic of a possible pandemic. 
At TEDxPlaceDesNations, epidemiologist Bruce Aylward outlined four strategies to win the fight against Ebola.</p>

<p>Finding a ripple on space-time: Back in 1916, Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves — ripples in space-time caused by a catastrophic cosmic event — when he mapped out his theory of relativity. Problem was, he didn’t have any proof. No one did, actually. Such waves could be the result of a collision of two black holes, supernovae, or leftover gravitational radiation from the birth of the Universe, among other possibilities. In September 2015, LIGO caught up with Einstein and detected real gravitational waves caused by two colliding black holes, an event dating back to the beginning of the Universe. The announcement of the find, after months of careful checking, came in February 2016.
At TED2016, theoretical physicist Allan Adams of LIGO  shared exactly how this discovery happened and the decades of work that led to it:</p>

<p>Finally, a climate agreement: With fits and bursts of underwhelming success, there have been a handful of global agreements, like the Kyoto Protocol, aimed at tackling climate change. The problem was that these agreements weren’t nearly as global as was hoped, with major powers like the US refusing to ratify. As the effects of climate change became more present and alarming, a new approach was needed, one with comprehensive proposals and a larger coalition of signatories. In December 2015, climate advocate Christiana Figueres was tapped to lead the Paris climate conference by the UN. At TED2016, Figueres shared how she brought 195 world leaders together to agree on a way to slow climate change, resulting in a consensus on the most important climate agreement in history.</p>

<p>The legacy of Nelson Mandela: There is no need  to spell out Nelson Mandela’s remarkable legacy as a fearless fighter against apartheid (resulting in 27 years in jail) and later, South Africa’s first democratically elected black president. He won innumerable accolades, including the Nobel Peace Prize, and at TEDWomen 2013, South African environmental and literacy activist Boyd Varty shared what Mandela taught him about nature, “ubuntu”and interrelatedness. He gave this talk mere hours after Nelson Mandela passed away on December 5, 2013, at the age of 95.</p>

<p>How Americans voted for the first African American president: On January 20, 2009, Barack Obama was inaugurated as the 44th President of the United States, making him the very first African-American president in US history. One month later, statistician Nate Silver challenged the TED2009 audience with surprising experiments and insights on how much a candidate’s skin color affects their chances.</p>

<p>Trying to learn from Haiti: On January 10, 2010, a devastating 7.0 earthquake rocked Haiti, leaving over 222,000 people dead and much of its infrastructure in complete ruin. Later, after time of detailed study, reflection and analysis, TED Fellow Peter Haas shared with the TEDGlobal 2010 audience how bad building practices and design exacerbated the fatality of this natural disaster.</p>

<p>Looking ahead in Afghanistan: In 2005, Afghanistan was a broken country, recovering from war and riddled with corruption, and Ashraf Ghani was an academic and finance minister who shared ideas for how the country might begin to rebuild. In 2014, Ghani became president of Afghanistan.</p>

Astronomers have discovered a vast cloud of high-energy particles called a wind nebula around a rare ultra-magnetic neutron star, or magnetar, for the first time. The find offers a unique window into the properties, environment and outburst history of magnetars, which are the strongest magnets in the universe.
A neutron star is the crushed core of a massive star that ran out of fuel, collapsed under its own weight, and exploded as a supernova. Each one compresses the equivalent mass of half a million Earths into a ball just 12 miles (20 kilometers) across, or about the length of New York's Manhattan Island. Neutron stars are most commonly found as pulsars, which produce radio, visible light, X-rays and gamma rays at various locations in their surrounding magnetic fields. When a pulsar spins these regions in our direction, astronomers detect pulses of emission, hence the name.
&nbsp;
The X-ray image above shows extended emission around a source known as Swift J1834.9-0846, a rare ultra-magnetic neutron star called a magnetar. The glow arises from a cloud of fast-moving particles produced by the neutron star and corralled around it. Color indicates X-ray energies, with 2,000-3,000 electron volts (eV) in red, 3,000-4,500 eV in green, and 5,000 to 10,000 eV in blue. The image combines observations by the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton spacecraft taken on March 16 and Oct. 16, 2014.
Typical pulsar magnetic fields can be 100 billion to 10 trillion times stronger than Earth's. Magnetar fields reach strengths a thousand times stronger still, and scientists don't know the details of how they are created. Of about 2,600 neutron stars known, to date only 29 are classified as magnetars.
The newfound nebula surrounds a magnetar known as Swift J1834.9-0846 -- J1834.9 for short -- which was discovered by NASA's Swift satellite on Aug. 7, 2011, during a brief X-ray outburst. Astronomers suspect the object is associated with the W41 supernova remnant, located about 13,000 light-years away in the constellation Scutum toward the central part of our galaxy.
"Right now, we don't know how J1834.9 developed and continues to maintain a wind nebula, which until now was a structure only seen around young pulsars," said lead researcher George Younes, a postdoctoral researcher at George Washington University in Washington. "If the process here is similar, then about 10 percent of the magnetar's rotational energy loss is powering the nebula's glow, which would be the highest efficiency ever measured in such a system."
A month after the Swift discovery, a team led by Younes took another look at J1834.9 using the European Space Agency's (ESA) XMM-Newton X-ray observatory, which revealed an unusual lopsided glow about 15 light-years across centered on the magnetar. New XMM-Newton observations in March and October 2014, coupled with archival data from XMM-Newton and Swift, confirm this extended glow as the first wind nebula ever identified around a magnetar. A paper describing the analysis will be published by The Astrophysical Journal.
"For me the most interesting question is, why is this the only magnetar with a nebula? Once we know the answer, we might be able to understand what makes a magnetar and what makes an ordinary pulsar," said co-author Chryssa Kouveliotou, a professor in the Department of Physics at George Washington University's Columbian College of Arts and Sciences.
The most famous wind nebula, powered by a pulsar less than a thousand years old, lies at the heart of the Crab Nebula supernova remnant in the constellation Taurus. Young pulsars like this one rotate rapidly, often dozens of times a second. The pulsar's fast rotation and strong magnetic field work together to accelerate electrons and other particles to very high energies. This creates an outflow astronomers call a pulsar wind that serves as the source of particles making up in a wind nebula.
"Making a wind nebula requires large particle fluxes, as well as some way to bottle up the outflow so it doesn't just stream into space," said co-author Alice Harding, an astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. "We think the expanding shell of the supernova remnant serves as the bottle, confining the outflow for a few thousand years. When the shell has expanded enough, it becomes too weak to hold back the particles, which then leak out and the nebula fades away." This naturally explains why wind nebulae are not found among older pulsars, even those driving strong outflows.
A pulsar taps into its rotational energy to produce light and accelerate its pulsar wind. By contrast, a magnetar outburst is powered by energy stored in the super-strong magnetic field. When the field suddenly reconfigures to a lower-energy state, this energy is suddenly released in an outburst of X-rays and gamma rays. So while magnetars may not produce the steady breeze of a typical pulsar wind, during outbursts they are capable of generating brief gales of accelerated particles.
"The nebula around J1834.9 stores the magnetar's energetic outflows over its whole active history, starting many thousands of years ago," said team member Jonathan Granot, an associate professor in the Department of Natural Sciences at the Open University in Ra'anana, Israel. "It represents a unique opportunity to study the magnetar's historical activity, opening a whole new playground for theorists like me."
ESA's XMM-Newton satellite was launched on Dec. 10, 1999, from Kourou, French Guiana, and continues to make observations. NASA funded elements of the XMM-Newton instrument package and provides the NASA Guest Observer Facility at Goddard, which supports use of the observatory by U.S. astronomers.

  <p>With eruptions of ice and water vapor, and an ocean covered by an ice shell, Saturn’s moon Enceladus is one of the most fascinating in the Solar System, especially as interpretations of data provided by the Cassini spacecraft have been contradictory until now. Astronomers recently proposed a new model that reconciles different data sets and shows that the ice shell at Enceladus’s south pole may be only a few kilometers thick. This suggests that there is a strong heat source in the interior of Enceladus, an additional factor supporting the possible emergence of life in its ocean.</p>

  <p>Uranus and Neptune, the so-called ice giants, are the only major planets in our solar system that aren’t easily visible to the unaided eye. If you already know what these planets look like, and just need charts to find them, skip to the bottom of this article. But if you’ve never seen Uranus or Neptune before, it’s helpful to know how they were discovered in the first place. Every time you set out to find a new celestial object, you are in some sense reliving the original discovery.
The Discovery of Uranus
In 1779, an obscure amateur astronomer named William Herschel decided to view all the bright stars in the sky at high magnification, to see if they were double stars. Two years into this project, on March 13, 1781, he noticed a “star” in Taurus that looked quite different from all other 6th-magnitude stars when viewed at 227× in his homemade 6.2-inch reflecting telescope. When he observed it again four nights later, it had moved with respect to the background stars, proving that it was actually an object inside our solar system.

Wikimedia Commons / PD When professional astronomers viewed Herschel's "comet," they saw only a garden-variety star. That's because — unknown to him or anyone else — Herschel's homemade reflector was far superior to most professional scopes. But it was easy to watch Herschel's object moving from one night to the next, and that allowed mathematicians to compute its orbit. It turned out to take a nearly circular path around the Sun, just like all the known planets, and very unlike the elongated orbits of comets. And the new object was much farther from the Sun than any solar-system body had ever been seen before. Considering how bright it appeared, it must be many times bigger than Earth. Herschel had, in fact, stumbled upon the discovery Uranus — the first new planet discovered throughout all of human history. Locating this ice giant was the most revolutionary discovery since Galileo spotted the moons of Jupiter 170 years earlier. Herschel became an instant celebrity and won a stipend from the King of England that allowed him to become a full-time astronomer. How to Observe Uranus As the story of its discovery indicates, Uranus is easy to see, but not so easy to recognize as a planet. If you're willing to use our sky charts to identify the planet — taking it on faith that we're telling the truth — then you won't need any tools besides binoculars. In fact, you might be able to see Uranus with just your unaided eyes if your sky is very dark.

S&amp;T: Sean Walker But you'll need to examine the planet quite carefully with a telescope at 100× or higher to see that it's actually a tiny disk rather than a pinpoint of light like a star. That means that you need to pinpoint its location precisely. Being in the right general vicinity isn't good enough. It's easy to scan right over Uranus without noticing that it's anything but a regular star. Remember — many generations of highly skilled observers before Herschel did precisely that. The first step is to make sure that the planet is above the horizon — and preferably fairly high in the sky — when you plan to look for it. From January through May, Uranus is so close to the Sun that it's difficult or impossible to spot. You can see Uranus as early in the year as June if you're willing to get up before dawn, but the best time to view it in the evening sky is from September through December. January's not impossible, but you'll have to start right after sunset. Uranus is easy to locate if you have a telescope with an accurate Go To mount; otherwise, you'll need the charts at the bottom of this article. And if you need to brush-up your chart-reading skills, you might want to look at our online article Using a Map at the Telescope. You may be able to recognize Uranus just by its hue, which most people find faintly blue or green. Contributing Editor Tony Flanders can see the color even with his10×50 binoculars. Through a telescope, even at magnifications too low to see that planet's disk, you may notice that it shines with a steadier light than other similarly bright stars. And at 120× in a 70-mm telescope, Tony can quite clearly make out a tiny disk or dot — about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Don't expect to see any features on the ice giant planet, though. Even giant professional telescopes can barely do that. The Discovery of Neptune


Urbain Jean Joseph Le Verrier (1811&amp;#150;77) accurately calculated the position of an unseen planet based on the motion of Uranus. In his day, he was famous for both his brilliance and arrogance.

<p>Once Herschel had overturned the millennia-old wisdom that there were exactly five planets besides Earth, astronomers started actively searching for new ones. And indeed, four new planets were discovered between 1801 and 1807, all orbiting between Mars and Jupiter. But these were tiny compared to Earth, let alone Uranus — too small to show as extended disks through most telescopes. Herschel, by then the grand old man of astronomy, called them asteroids because they look just like stars (Latin astra). Asteroids’ rapid motion with respect to the “fixed” stars makes them great targets for backyard telescopes.
It wasn’t until 1846 that another really large planet was found. And Neptune, as the new planet came to be called, was found in much the same way that you’re going to find it. J. G. Galle and H. L. d’Arrest, staff astronomers at the Berlin Observatory, looked where the new planet was predicted to be, compared what they saw with a star chart, found an uncharted star, and then verified that it was in fact a planet.
But credit for the discovery goes not to the astronomers who first saw Neptune but to Urban Jean Joseph Le Verrier, who predicted where it would be found. It had been known for some time that Uranus didn’t move exactly as it should, taking the gravitational attraction of the Sun and the known planets into account. Le Verrier analyzed the discrepancy, concluded that it must be due to the pull of a large planet well outside Uranus’s orbit, and predicted the new planet’s location with an error of just one degree. It was a stunning triumph for theoretical astronomy.
How to Observe Neptune and Uranus
Neptune and Uranus are in Aquarius and Pisces, respectively, throughout this period. Uranus is fewer than 10° north of the celestial equator, and Neptune will be 9° to the south of the center line at the end of 2016 — so neither gets very high in the sky for people at mid-northern latitudes. So it’s important to make the best of the relatively short window of opportunity for viewing them. Neptune rises first, but because it’s so much fainter, it won’t actually be visible much earlier. Sometime in June or July, both planets become high enough for decent telescopic viewing in the predawn sky.
The two planets are near-twins in actual size, but Neptune is about 50% more distant, which makes it surprisingly much harder to find. But if you can find Uranus, you can find Neptune too, with the aid of the charts below. It just requires using the same techniques more carefully.
Neptune varies from magnitude 7.8 to 8.0, about two magnitudes fainter than Uranus. It’s visible in steadily-supported binoculars, but only if you look quite carefully. And while Uranus is frequently brighter than any other star visible in the same binocular or finderscope field, the sky is crowded full of stars as bright as Neptune. So you have to be careful when you match up your charts with what you see through the eyepiece.
Having said all that, it’s worth remembering that even a very small telescope can easily show stars down to eighth or ninth magnitude. So Neptune is not faint by telescopic standards. In fact, it’s bright enough to stimulate color vision through any telescope with 4 inches (100 mm) of aperture. Look for a hue quite similar to Uranus’s, though somewhat bluer.
Neptune’s disk is plainly visible at 200× through a 6-inch telescope on a night of steady seeing. But it may be quite hard to see the disk if conditions are bad or your telescope is improperly collimated. Tony Flander’s 70-mm refractor is a little too small to resolve Neptune properly, but when he examines the planet carefully at 120× it looks clearly different from a star of similar brightness. Neptune’s light is distinctly steadier, and it appears more solid. Not exactly a disk, but a fat pinpoint. It’s a little more clear in a 90-mm refractor, but don’t take our word for it; see for yourself what Neptune looks like!</p>

<p>Charts and Tools for Observing
Because Uranus and Neptune are so far from the Sun, they move very slowly across the celestial sphere. They appeared side-by-side in 1993, and they’ve only drifted about 42° apart since then. So they’re still visible at more or less the same time of year and/or night.
Neptune reaches opposition to the Sun on September 2nd (16:23 UT), and Uranus on October 15th (10:30 UT). These are the dates when the planets rise around sunset, set around sunrise, and reach their highest in the sky in the middle of the night. Neptune is reasonably well placed in the evening sky from August through December, and Uranus from September through February 2017. They’re detectable after that, but too low for high-power telescopic observing.

<blockquote>
  <p>“When our senses become muffled, we no longer feel fully alive… If you have a comfortable connection with your inner sensations … you will feel in charge of your body, your feelings, and your self.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“A purely disembodied human emotion is a nonentity,” William James asserted in his revolutionary 1884 theory of how our bodies affect our feelings. Two generations later, Rilke wrote in a beautiful letter of advice to a young woman: “I am not one of those who neglect the body in order to make of it a sacrificial offering for the soul, since my soul would thoroughly dislike being served in such a fashion.” And yet in the century since, we’ve made little progress on making sense — much less making use — of the inextricable dialogue between the physical body and the psychoemotional interior landscape we shorthand as “soul.”
Nowhere is this relationship more essential yet more endangered than in our healing from trauma, and no one has provided a more illuminating, sympathetic, and constructive approach to such healing than Boston-based Dutch psychiatrist and pioneering PTSD researcher Bessel van der Kolk. In The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma (public library), he explores “the extreme disconnection from the body that so many people with histories of trauma and neglect experience” and the most fertile paths to recovery by drawing on his own work and a wealth of other research in three main areas of study: neuroscience, which deals with how mental processes function within the brain; developmental psychopathology, concerned with how painful experiences impact the development of mind and brain; and interpersonal neurobiology, which examines how our own behavior affects the psychoemotional and neurobiological states of those close to us.
Art by Simona Ciraolo from Hug Me
Trauma, Van der Kolk notes, affects not only those who have suffered it but also those who surround them and, especially, those who love them. He writes:
One does not have be a combat soldier, or visit a refugee camp in Syria or the Congo to encounter trauma. Trauma happens to us, our friends, our families, and our neighbors. Research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has shown that one in five Americans was sexually molested as a child; one in four was beaten by a parent to the point of a mark being left on their body; and one in three couples engages in physical violence. A quarter of us grew up with alcoholic relatives, and one out of eight witnessed their mother being beaten or hit.
[…]
It takes tremendous energy to keep functioning while carrying the memory of terror, and the shame of utter weakness and vulnerability.
In trauma survivors, Van der Kolk notes, the parts of the brain that have evolved to monitor for danger remain overactivated and even the slightest sign of danger, real or misperceived, can trigger an acute stress response accompanied by intense unpleasant emotions and overwhelming sensations. Such posttraumatic reactions make it difficult for survivors to connect with other people, since closeness often triggers the sense of danger. And yet the very thing we come to most dread after experiencing trauma — close contact with other people — is also the thing we most need in order to regain psychoemotional solidity and begin healing. Van der Kolk writes:
Being able to feel safe with other people is probably the single most important aspect of mental health; safe connections are fundamental to meaningful and satisfying lives.
This, he points out, is why we’ve evolved a refined mechanism for detecting danger — we’re incredibly attuned to even the subtlest emotional shifts in those around us and, even if we don’t always heed these intuitive readings, we can read another person’s friendliness or hostility on the basis of such imperceptible cues as brow tension, lip curvature, and body angles. But one of the most pernicious effects of trauma is that it disrupts this ability to accurately read others, rendering the trauma survivor either less able to detect danger or more likely to misperceive danger where there is none. 
Art by Wolf Erlbruch from Duck, Death and the Tulip
Paradoxically, what normalizes and repairs our ability to read danger and safety correctly is human connection. Van der Kolk writes:
Social support is not the same as merely being in the presence of others. The critical issue is reciprocity: being truly heard and seen by the people around us, feeling that we are held in someone else’s mind and heart. For our physiology to calm down, heal, and grow we need a visceral feeling of safety. No doctor can write a prescription for friendship and love: These are complex and hard-earned capacities. You don’t need a history of trauma to feel self-conscious and even panicked at a party with strangers — but trauma can turn the whole world into a gathering of aliens.
Beginning to adequately address trauma requires a cultural shift away from the disease model on which twentieth-century psychology and psychiatry were built. (That model has seeded a number of cultural deformities, affecting everything from our longtime denial of the robust relationship between stress and physical illness to the way we make sense of our romantic failures.) Trauma and its psychological consequences, Van der Kolk argues, is not a mental disease but an adaptation. He writes:
The brain-disease model overlooks four fundamental truths: (1) our capacity to destroy one another is matched by our capacity to heal one another. Restoring relationships and community is central to restoring well-being; (2) language gives us the power to change ourselves and others by communicating our experiences, helping us to define what we know, and finding a common sense of meaning; (3) we have the ability to regulate our own physiology, including some of the so-called involuntary functions of the body and brain, through such basic activities as breathing, moving, and touching; and (4) we can change social conditions to create environments in which children and adults can feel safe and where they can thrive. 
When we ignore these quintessential dimensions of humanity, we deprive people of ways to heal from trauma and restore their autonomy. Being a patient, rather than a participant in one’s healing process, separates suffering people from their community and alienates them from an inner sense of self.
One of Salvador Dalí’s illustrations for the essays of Montaigne
The most essential aspect of healing, Van der Kolk asserts, is learning to fully inhabit that inner sense of self in all of its dimensions — not only emotional and psychological, but bodily — which are inseparable from one another. He explains:
The natural state of mammals is to be somewhat on guard. However, in order to feel emotionally close to another human being, our defensive system must temporarily shut down. In order to play, mate, and nurture our young, the brain needs to turn off its natural vigilance. 
Many traumatized individuals are too hypervigilant to enjoy the ordinary pleasures that life has to offer, while others are too numb to absorb new experiences — or to be alert to signs of real danger.
[…]
Many people feel safe as long as they can limit their social contact to superficial conversations, but actual physical contact can trigger intense reactions. However … achieving any sort of deep intimacy — a close embrace, sleeping with a mate, and sex — requires allowing oneself to experience immobilization without fear. It is especially challenging for traumatized people to discern when they are actually safe and to be able to activate their defenses when they are in danger. This requires having experiences that can restore the sense of physical safety.
One place where our culture fails, Van der Kolk argues, is in integrating this physical aspect with the psychoemotional infrastructure of experience — a failure spanning from our clinical methods of treating trauma to our education system. (More than half a century ago, Aldous Huxley wrote beautifully about the need for an integrated mind-body system of education.) Education, Van der Kolk notes, tends to engage the cognitive capacities of the mind rather than the bodily-emotional engagement system, which makes for an ultimately incomplete model of human experience. In a sobering passage that should be etched onto the wall of every Department of Education the world over, he writes:
Despite the well-documented effects of anger, fear, and anxiety on the ability to reason, many programs continue to ignore the need to engage the safety system of the brain before trying to promote new ways of thinking. The last things that should be cut from school schedules are chorus, physical education, recess, and anything else involving movement, play, and joyful engagement. When children are oppositional, defensive, numbed out, or enraged, it’s also important to recognize that such “bad behavior” may repeat action patterns that were established to survive serious threats, even if they are intensely upsetting or off-putting.
Illustration by Peter Brown from My Teacher Is a Monster
With an eye to heartening counterpoints like a karate program for rape survivors and a theater program in Boston’s inner-city schools, he considers the reasons and the urgency for engaging the body in healing:
The body keeps the score: If the memory of trauma is encoded in the viscera, in heartbreaking and gut-wrenching emotions, in autoimmune disorders and skeletal/muscular problems, and if mind/brain/visceral communication is the royal road to emotion regulation, this demands a radical shift in our therapeutic assumptions.
Drawing on his work with patients who have survived a variety of traumatic experiences — from plane crashes to rape to torture — Van der Kolk considers the great challenge of those of us living with trauma:
When our senses become muffled, we no longer feel fully alive.
[…]
In response to the trauma itself, and in coping with the dread that persisted long afterward, these patients had learned to shut down the brain areas that transmit the visceral feelings and emotions that accompany and define terror. Yet in everyday life, those same brain areas are responsible for registering the entire range of emotions and sensations that form the foundation of our self-awareness, our sense of who we are. What we witnessed here was a tragic adaptation: In an effort to shut off terrifying sensations, they also deadened their capacity to feel fully alive.
Art by Oliver Jeffers from The Heart and the Bottle, a tender illustrated parable of what happens when we deny our difficult emotions
While this dissociation from the body is an adaptive response to trauma, the troublesome day-to-day anguish comes from the retriggering of this remembered response by stimuli that don’t remotely warrant it. Van der Kolk examines the interior machinery at play:
The elementary self system in the brain stem and limbic system is massively activated when people are faced with the threat of annihilation, which results in an overwhelming sense of fear and terror accompanied by intense physiological arousal. To people who are reliving a trauma, nothing makes sense; they are trapped in a life-or-death situation, a state of paralyzing fear or blind rage. Mind and body are constantly aroused, as if they are in imminent danger. They startle in response to the slightest noises and are frustrated by small irritations. Their sleep is chronically disturbed, and food often loses its sensual pleasures. This in turn can trigger desperate attempts to shut those feelings down by freezing and dissociation.
In a passage that calls to mind philosopher Martha Nussbaum’s excellent subsequent writings on the nuanced relationship between agency and victimhood, Van der Kolk adds:
Agency starts with what scientists call interoception, our awareness of our subtle sensory, body-based feelings: the greater that awareness, the greater our potential to control our lives. Knowing what we feel is the first step to knowing why we feel that way. If we are aware of the constant changes in our inner and outer environment, we can mobilize to manage them.
But one of the most pernicious effects of trauma, Van der Kolk notes, is that it disrupts our ability to know what we feel — that is, to trust our gut feelings — and this mistrust makes us misperceive threat where there is none. This, in turn, creates an antagonistic relationship with our own bodies. He explains:
If you have a comfortable connection with your inner sensations — if you can trust them to give you accurate information — you will feel in charge of your body, your feelings, and your self. 
However, traumatized people chronically feel unsafe inside their bodies: The past is alive in the form of gnawing interior discomfort. Their bodies are constantly bombarded by visceral warning signs, and, in an attempt to control these processes, they often become expert at ignoring their gut feelings and in numbing awareness of what is played out inside. They learn to hide from their selves.
The more people try to push away and ignore internal warning signs, the more likely they are to take over and leave them bewildered, confused, and ashamed. People who cannot comfortably notice what is going on inside become vulnerable to respond to any sensory shift either by shutting down or by going into a panic — they develop a fear of fear itself.
[…]
The experience of fear derives from primitive responses to threat where escape is thwarted in some way. People’s lives will be held hostage to fear until that visceral experience changes… Self-regulation depends on having a friendly relationship with your body. Without it you have to rely on external regulation — from medication, drugs like alcohol, constant reassurance, or compulsive compliance with the wishes of others.
In its extreme, this lack of internal regulation leads to retraumatizing experiences:
Because traumatized people often have trouble sensing what is going on in their bodies, they lack a nuanced response to frustration. They either react to stress by becoming “spaced out” or with excessive anger. Whatever their response, they often can’t tell what is upsetting them. This failure to be in touch with their bodies contributes to their well-documented lack of self-protection and high rates of revictimization and also to their remarkable difficulties feeling pleasure, sensuality, and having a sense of meaning.
[…]
One step further down on the ladder to self-oblivion is depersonalization — losing your sense of yourself.
What, then, can we do to regain agency in our very selves? Pointing to decades of research with trauma survivors, Van der Kolk argues that it begins with befriending our bodies and their sensory interiority:
Trauma victims cannot recover until they become familiar with and befriend the sensations in their bodies. Being frightened means that you live in a body that is always on guard. Angry people live in angry bodies. The bodies of child-abuse victims are tense and defensive until they find a way to relax and feel safe. In order to change, people need to become aware of their sensations and the way that their bodies interact with the world around them. Physical self-awareness is the first step in releasing the tyranny of the past.
In a sentiment that calls to mind Schopenhauer’s porcupine dilemma, Van der Kolk writes:
The most natural way for human beings to calm themselves when they are upset is by clinging to another person. This means that patients who have been physically or sexually violated face a dilemma: They desperately crave touch while simultaneously being terrified of body contact. The mind needs to be reeducated to feel physical sensations, and the body needs to be helped to tolerate and enjoy the comforts of touch. Individuals who lack emotional awareness are able, with practice, to connect their physical sensations to psychological events. Then they can slowly reconnect with themselves.
How we respond to trauma, Van der Kolk asserts, is to a large extent conditioned by our formative relationships with our caretakers, whose task is to help us establish a secure base. Essential to this is the notion of attunement between parent and child, mediated by the body — those subtlest of physical interactions in which the caretaker mirrors and meets the baby’s needs, making the infant feel attended to and understood. 
Art by Isol from The Menino
Attunement is the foundation of secure attachment, which is in turn the scaffolding of psychoemotional health later in life. Van der Kolk writes:
A secure attachment combined with the cultivation of competency builds an internal locus of control, the key factor in healthy coping throughout life. Securely attached children learn what makes them feel good; they discover what makes them (and others) feel bad, and they acquire a sense of agency: that their actions can change how they feel and how others respond. Securely attached kids learn the difference between situations they can control and situations where they need help. They learn that they can play an active role when faced with difficult situations. In contrast, children with histories of abuse and neglect learn that their terror, pleading, and crying do not register with their caregiver. Nothing they can do or say stops the beating or brings attention and help. In effect they’re being conditioned to give up when they face challenges later in life.
With an eye to the immensely influential work of psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, who pioneered the study of attachment and the notion that attunement between mother and infant lays the foundation for the child’s sense of self later in life, Van der Kolk summarizes these foundational findings:
If a mother cannot meet her baby’s impulses and needs, “the baby learns to become the mother’s idea of what the baby is.” Having to discount its inner sensations, and trying to adjust to its caregiver’s needs, means the child perceives that “something is wrong” with the way it is. Children who lack physical attunement are vulnerable to shutting down the direct feedback from their bodies, the seat of pleasure, purpose, and direction.
[…]
The need for attachment never lessens. Most human beings simply cannot tolerate being disengaged from others for any length of time. People who cannot connect through work, friendships, or family usually find other ways of bonding, as through illnesses, lawsuits, or family feuds. Anything is preferable to that godforsaken sense of irrelevance and alienation.
Although we can’t prevent most traumatic experiences from happening, having a solid formative foundation can make healing much easier. But what are those of us unblessed with secure attachment to do? Pointing to his mindfulness-based work with trauma survivors, Van der Kolk offers an assuring direction:
Nobody can “treat” a war, or abuse, rape, molestation, or any other horrendous event, for that matter; what has happened cannot be undone. But what can be dealt with are the imprints of the trauma on body, mind, and soul: the crushing sensations in your chest that you may label as anxiety or depression; the fear of losing control; always being on alert for danger or rejection; the self-loathing; the nightmares and flashbacks; the fog that keeps you from staying on task and from engaging fully in what you are doing; being unable to fully open your heart to another human being.
The crucial point is that trauma robs us of what Van der Kolk terms “self-leadership” — the sense of having agency over ourselves and being in charge of our own experience. The path to recovery is therefore paved with the active rebuilding of that sense. He writes:
The challenge of recovery is to reestablish ownership of your body and your mind — of your self. This means feeling free to know what you know and to feel what you feel without becoming overwhelmed, enraged, ashamed, or collapsed. For most people this involves (1) finding a way to become calm and focused, (2) learning to maintain that calm in response to images, thoughts, sounds, or physical sensations that remind you of the past, (3) finding a way to be fully alive in the present and engaged with the people around you, (4) not having to keep secrets from yourself, including secrets about the ways that you have managed to survive.
Art by Giselle Potter from Tell Me What to Dream About
One of the paradoxical necessities of the recovery process is the need to revisit the trauma without becoming so overwhelmed by sensations as to be retraumatized. The way to accomplish this, Van der Kolk argues, is by learning to be present with these overwhelming emotions and their sensorial counterparts in the body. He writes:
Traumatized people live with seemingly unbearable sensations: They feel heartbroken and suffer from intolerable sensations in the pit of their stomach or tightness in their chest. Yet avoiding feeling these sensations in our bodies increases our vulnerability to being overwhelmed by them.
[…]
Traumatized people are often afraid of feeling. It is not so much the perpetrators (who, hopefully, are no longer around to hurt them) but their own physical sensations that now are the enemy. Apprehension about being hijacked by uncomfortable sensations keeps the body frozen and the mind shut. Even though the trauma is a thing of the past, the emotional brain keeps generating sensations that make the sufferer feel scared and helpless. It’s not surprising that so many trauma survivors are compulsive eaters and drinkers, fear making love, and avoid many social activities: Their sensory world is largely off limits.
Another paradox of healing is that although contact and connection are often terrifying to the traumatized, social support and a sense of community are the foundation upon which a health relationship with our own feelings and sensations is built. Half a century after Dorothy Day’s memorable assertion that “we have all known the long loneliness and we have learned that the only solution is love and that love comes with community,” Van der Kolk writes:
All of us, but especially children, need … confidence that others will know, affirm, and cherish us. Without that we can’t develop a sense of agency that will enable us to assert: “This is what I believe in; this is what I stand for; this is what I will devote myself to.” As long as we feel safely held in the hearts and minds of the people who love us, we will climb mountains and cross deserts and stay up all night to finish projects. Children and adults will do anything for people they trust and whose opinion they value. But if we feel abandoned, worthless, or invisible, nothing seems to matter. Fear destroys curiosity and playfulness. In order to have a healthy society we must raise children who can safely play and learn. There can be no growth without curiosity and no adaptability without being able to explore, through trial and error, who you are and what matters to you.
The pathways, both practical and psychological, to doing that is what Van der Kolk goes on to explore in the remainder of the revelatory, redemptive, and immensely helpful The Body Keeps the Score. Complement it with Walt Whitman on healing the body and the spirit, pioneering immunologist Esther Sternberg on the science of how our emotions affect our susceptibility to burnout and disease, artist Marina Abramovic on turning trauma into raw material for art, then treat yourself to Van der Kolk’s magnificent On Being conversation with Krista Tippett:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tens of millions of people live with autism and thousands of doctors and scientists study it. But the condition remains shrouded in mystery. “Autism proves to be a sprawling, foggy and inconsistent field,” writes the author David Mitchell, whose son is autistic. “Causes are unknown, though many careers are fueled by educated guesses.”
The term “autism” has been around for more than a century, though our understanding of the condition has changed substantially. Physicians today talk about autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a broad group of conditions that affect the brain. But they are still looking for tools to diagnose it, assess where people fall on the autism spectrum and treat them. “Right now, diagnosing ASD is almost entirely based on behavior,” says Professor Steve Williams, who founded and leads the neuroimaging department at King’s College London. “We need more.”
Williams is part of a team of researchers funded in part by the EU-AIMS (European Autism Interventions — A Multicentre Study for Developing New Medications) program. The team is using GE magnetic resonance scanners (MRI) and recently developed machine-learning software to find the anatomical biomarkers in the brain that are the hallmarks of autism. “MRI is helping us to understand the underlying biology of the condition,” Williams says. “If we can diagnose earlier and determine the differences in brain biology, then we can begin to develop potential treatments.”

The researchers are using several different MRI protocols to look at the brain, including structural, functional and something called “diffusion tensor MRI tractography” (see top image). This allows them to measure the brain’s shape, size and thickness. The also study the microstructure of the brain’s white matter and its integrity, and also variations in neurotransmitters like glutamate and GABA, which enable and prevent communication between neurons. “Research and diagnosis of autism is not a question of black-and-white,” Williams says. “The autism continuum includes highly functioning individuals and, on the other hand, people who are severely disabled. Biomarkers could help doctors determine where patients fall on the spectrum and may also help to destigmatize the condition by showing the underlying biological differences.”
Such biomarkers would be extremely useful for both children and adults. A 2010 paper on autism in adults, co-written by Williams’ colleagues, pointed out that “increasing awareness of autism has resulted in a large increase of people seeking a diagnosis of autism,” but “just over 50 percent” of them do not have ASD. “This consumes very significant health care resources, and so we need to identify new cost-effective methods to aid current diagnostic practice,” they wrote. The authors estimate that the lifetime cost for someone living with autism can reach 4.7 million pounds (roughly $6.8 million).
The EU-AIMS team is getting results. Its researchers have used MRI to show changes in thickness of the outer layer of the brain, called the cortex, between people with ASD and a control group. MRI in combination with pattern recognition software allows them to rapidly detect subtle but significant differences that are not visible to the naked eye. The team is also gathering data on the biomarkers that could help pharmaceutical companies and doctors classify patients on the autism spectrum and develop and apply the most effective treatments. The latest research is studying the impact of neurotransmitters on ASD.
Williams has been working with GE MRI scanners for several years. Unlike X-rays or CT scanners, MRI does not produce ionizing radiation, allowing us to safely study brain changes in the same subject repeatedly over several years. He says the latest generation of scanners are also quiet, which is a bonus with autistic patients, who are often sensitive to loud noises. “If you want to visualize the progression of functional, physiological and neurochemical changes in the brain,” Williams says, “there’s no other way.”

  <p>The gravitational wave observatory has detected a second event, heralding a new era in astrophysics. 
This image depicts two black holes in the moments before a catastrophic collision.S. Ossokine / A. Buonanno /  T. Dietrich / R. Haas / Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics / the Simulating eXtreme Spacetime (SXS) project 
The day after Christmas last year, the cosmos quietly gifted scientists with gravitational waves — ripples in the fabric of spacetime – produced in a collision between two stellar-mass black holes. It’s the second event detected by physicists working with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), and it suggests that after some fine-tuning LIGO will be spotting dozens of these events each year.
The first discovery, detected last September and announced this February, was an astounding achievement for science, another piece of evidence proving Einstein’s general theory of relativity correct and, moreover, throwing open a new window on the cosmos. It ushered in an era where astronomers can use gravitational waves to detect black holes previously hidden from view. At the time, LIGO Executive Director David Reitze called it a “scientific moonshot.”
A Second Landing
And the second event is no less remarkable. The two black holes, which weighed in at roughly 7.5 and 14.2 times the mass of the sun, had been circling each other for eons before they finally crashed together 1.4 billion years ago. The bang was so furious — with energy equivalent to the entire mass of the sun — that it sent shudders across the universe.
As those gravitational waves rippled through the universe, they stretched and squeezed the fabric of space-time by an exceedingly tiny amount. At the LIGO detectors, for example, they distorted space-time by as much as three parts in 1022. “That’s like changing the distance between the earth and the sun by a fraction of an atomic diameter,” says Gabriela Gonzalez (Louisiana State University), chair of the LIGO collaboration, in a much-anticipated press conference yesterday at the American Astronomical Society meeting in San Diego.
In this schematic of LIGO, a beamsplitter sends light along two paths perpendicular to each other. Each beam bounces between two mirrors, one of which allows a fraction of the light through. When the two transmitted beams meet and interfere, they’ll cancel each other out — if the length of the path they’ve each traveled has remained constant. But if a gravitational wave passes through, it’ll warp spacetime and change that distance, creating an interference pattern. S&amp;T: Leah Tiscione
LIGO can detect such a miniscule distortion with the help of two laser beams that bounce between mirrors at the opposite ends of 4-kilometer-long vacuum pipes. As the gravitational waves pass through the detector, they cause the length of one of the pipes to shorten or expand, forcing that pipe’s laser beam to arrive a fraction of a second before or after the other pipe’s.
In December, this allowed scientists to detect a wave whose oscillation began at 35 cycles per second (hertz) and rapidly increased to 450 hertz. When converted to an audible sound, the wave makes an unmistakable chirp. “This is what we call gravity’s music,” says Gonzalez. And the first chirp took the world by storm.
But the two chirps detected so far are not quite identical, revealing vast differences between the two fender benders that produced them. The first signal LIGO spied radiated outward from two surprisingly heavy stellar-mass black holes. As such the chirp was loud but short. It lasted only 0.2 seconds and allowed scientists to glimpse the last 10 cycles of the black holes’ orbits before their collision. But the latest signal radiated outward from two lighter black holes. This chirp was weak, barely visible above the noise, but long. It lasted a full second and allowed scientists to witness the last 55 orbits of the black holes’ inspiral.
“The first LIGO detection was a whopping huge signal from improbably large, merging black holes,” says Chiara Mingarelli, a gravitational wave astronomer from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, who is not a part of the LIGO collaboration. “This second signal tells us more about the [typical] population of black holes in the local universe.”
The latest result also suggests that one of the black holes was spinning at roughly 20 percent of the maximum theoretical spin rate for a black hole. “A measurement of the binary black hole’s spin can serve as an indicator, or tracer, of how the binary came to be and how it evolved,” says Mingarelli. “A binary that formed in a relatively isolated system is expected to have aligned spins, whereas if the binary formed in a dense environment, one would expect the spins to be misaligned.” Thus, future detections should relay the black holes’ surroundings and hint as to how they formed.
A New Era
Perhaps more importantly, the second observation shows that LIGO has only just begun. “The future is going to be full of binary black hole mergers from LIGO,” says Reitze. “We’re going to see a lot more of these as we go forward.”
The next run, which begins in the fall, will increase its sensitivity by 15 to 25 percent. Given that the last four-month run resulted in two mergers, Reitze expects that the added sensitivity will result in six to eight mergers over the six-month run. That’s important because researchers would like to collect enough findings to study the frequency of black hole collisions across the universe. (The team also observed an additional event in the first run that was too weak to confirm.)
Physicists hope that LIGO will eventually detect gravitational waves from other, fainter, types of cosmic collisions, like those between neutron stars. These events are expected to both trigger gravitational waves and emit electromagnetic radiation. A detection of both could allow astronomers to better understand such wild events. But first, physicists need to pinpoint them on the sky. More gravitational-wave detectors coming online in the coming years, including one in Italy and two in India, will help scientists do just that.
But before we get ahead of ourselves, the second detection alone is still an event to marvel at. “With this, we can tell you now that the era of gravitational wave astronomy has begun,” says Gonzalez.
