The original Pi Zero was great (and still is!)—but many people found its lack of wireless connectivity an inconvenience. Now with Zero W, you can connect to the Internet without using any adapters, and you can even use a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard rather than wired USB, or use a Bluetooth speaker for audio. The latest addition to the Raspberry Pi family has the same specifications as the original Pi Zero: read more...

>(University of Ottawa) As we saw during the 2016 US election, protecting traditional computer systems, which use zeros and ones, from hackers is not a perfect science. Now consider the complex world of quantum computing, where bits of information can simultaneously hold multiple states beyond zero and one, and the potential threats become even trickier to tackle. Researchers at the University of Ottawa have uncovered clues that could help administrators protect quantum computing networks from external attacks....

But they also occur at the quantum mechanical level, where they are -- in spite of their importance for various fields of physics -- relatively unexplored....

>by Juliann E. Aukema, Narcisa G. Pricope, Gregory J. Husak, David Lopez-Carr Humans and the ecosystem services they depend on are threatened by climate change. Places with high or growing human population as well as increasing climate variability, have a reduced ability to provide ecosystem services just as the need for these services is most critical. A spiral of vulnerability and ecosystem degradation often ensues in such places. We apply different global conservation schemes as proxies to examine the spatial relation between wet season precipitation, population change over three decades, and natural resource conservation. We pose two research questions: 1) Where are biodiversity and ecosystem services vulnerable to the combined effects...
