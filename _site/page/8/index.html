  <p>China’s Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT), the country’s first X-ray observatory — not to mention its first astronomical satellite — headed to orbit last week.

China entered the orbital X-ray astronomy game last week as a Long March 4B rocket roared to life, hoisting the nation’s first astronomical observatory into space.
The launch occurred from China’s Jiuquan space center on Thursday, June 15th at 3:00 UT / 11:00 p.m. EDT on June 14th. HXMT was renamed Huiyan (Chinese for “insight”) shortly after launch. Three other smaller Earth-observing satellites, including Argentina’s NuSat-3 and two of the Chinese company Orbita’s Zhuhai satellites also hitched a ride to space along with the observatory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To study the high-energy universe, you have to get up above the Earth’s atmosphere, which absorbs cosmic X-rays on their way to our planet’s surface. In fact, it was brief sounding-rocket flights that carried out our very first X-ray observations of the Sun, using captured Nazi V-2 rockets that were launched from the White Sands missile range in 1949. Now, several X-ray observatories circle Earth, including NASA’s Chandra, NuSTAR, and Swift telescopes, as well as the European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton.
China’s HXMT joins this cohort to study X-ray sources such as supermassive black holes in distant galaxies, as well as stellar-mass black holes and pulsars in our own galaxy. HMXT will also survey the sky across the galactic plane on the hunt for new, short-lived X-ray sources, mapping out the cosmic X-ray background in the process. HXMT sees in gamma rays as well: It can catch gamma-ray bursts in the range of 3 million electron-volts (3 MeV). The mission could work in tandem with China’s new Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to study the properties of millisecond pulsars, in hopes of using these sources as navigational beacons for deep-space missions.
HXMT followed a long road to the launch pad. The mission was first proposed 1993 and moved ahead into the early development stage in 2000. Originally, China hoped to launch the observatory in 2010, but funding constraints pushed the mission over three of China’s Five Year Plans for development to 2017.
HXMT undergoes testing in the lab. Institute of High Energy Physics (Chinese Academy of Sciences)
The Tsinghua University, the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute for High-Energy Physics (IHEP) collaborate in operating the telescope. The HXMT team has released a statement on their website on June 19th, which reports that the spacecraft is healthy and its low and medium energy detectors have successfully switched on.
HXMT joins China’s Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) as the second premier astronomical observatory in low-Earth orbit.
Want to catch a glimpse yourself? HXMT is in a 43°-inclined, 536- by 546-kilometer orbit, going around the Earth once every 95 minutes. This orbit means that — like Hubble and Hitomi — the observatory will be visible to naked-eye satellite observers from about latitude 45°N to 45°S. Heavens-Above is a great place to check for local passes: HXMT’s NORAD ID is (42758) 2017-034A.
How the Hard X-ray Modulating Telescope “Sees” X-rays
HXMT couples an incredible range of energy coverage, from 1 to 250 keV, with wide sky coverage. To achieve this, the observatory uses three detectors with overlapping energy regimes: low energies (1–15 keV), medium energies (5–30 keV), and high energies (20–250 keV). The high-energy detector is the main science instrument and has the greatest sensitivity of the three detectors. Another instrument, designed to help calibrate the high-energy detector, can also detect gamma-ray bursts between 300 keV and 3,000 keV in energy.
Rather than using complex and expensive nested mirrors to focus the X-rays, HXMT employs an innovative focusing technique, filtering out all X-rays except those that are coming in parallel to a specified direction. Thanks to this method, the telescope doesn’t have to narrow its field of view, making it an ideal instrument for large sky surveys. The trade-off for its broad energy and sky coverage is its sensitivity (that is, the faintest source it can pick up), which is on par with the now-retired Rossi Timing X-ray Explorer (RXTE).
The sensitivities of the three detectors aboard the HXMT versus the sensitivities of NuSTAR, INTEGRAL / IBIS and RXTE / HEXTE.BCAS / Koglin et al.
The Future of X-ray Astronomy
The European Space Agency (ESA) plans to collaborate with the Chinese observatory, enabling comparisons between observations from HXMT and ESA’s XMM-Newton. In a 2016 interview, HXMT Principle Investigator Zhang Shuangnan also mentions possible collaboration with NASA’s NuSTAR team.
Perhaps the mission will usher in a new era of international scientific collaboration along with a new era for X-ray astronomy.

  <p>You’ve probably heard about Schrödinger’s cat, which famously is trapped in a box with a mechanism that is activated if a radioactive atom decays, releasing radiation. The act of looking in the box collapses the atom’s wave function—the mathematical description of its state —from a “superposition” of states to a definite state, which either kills the cat or let’s it live another day.</p>

Over a period of three years, a group of astrophysicists from the University of Zurich has developed and optimised a revolutionary code to describe with unprecedented accuracy the dynamics of dark matter and the formation of large-scale structures in the Universe. From the data, researchers will obtain new information on the nature of this mysterious dark energy, but also hope to discover new physics beyond the standard model, such as a modified version of general relativity or a new type of particle.

The researchers have simulated the formation of our entire Universe with a large supercomputer. A gigantic catalog of about 25 billion virtual galaxies has been generated from 2 trillion digital particles. This catalogue is being used to calibrate the experiments on board the Euclid satellite, that will be launched in 2020 with the objective of investigating the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
The image below shows a section of the virtual universe, a billion light years across, showing how dark matter is distributed in space, with dark matter halos the yellow clumps, interconnected by dark filaments. Cosmic void, shown as the white areas, are the lowest density regions in the Universe. (Joachim Stadel, UZH)

&nbsp;
Over a period of three years, the astrophysicists from the University of Zurich has developed and optimised a revolutionary code to describe with unprecedented accuracy the dynamics of dark matter and the formation of large-scale structures in the Universe.
As Joachim Stadel, Douglas Potter and Romain Teyssier report in their recently published paper, the code (called PKDGRAV3) has been designed to use optimally the available memory and processing power of modern supercomputing architectures, such as the "Piz Daint" supercomputer of the Swiss National Computing Center (CSCS). The code was executed on this world-leading machine for only 80 hours, and generated a virtual universe of two trillion (i.e., two thousand billion or 2 x 1012) macro-particles representing the dark matter fluid, from which a catalogue of 25 billion virtual galaxies was extracted.
Thanks to the high precision of their calculation, featuring a dark matter fluid evolving under its own gravity, the researchers have simulated the formation of small concentration of matter, called dark matter halos, in which we believe galaxies like the Milky Way form. The challenge of this simulation was to model galaxies as small as one tenth of the Milky Way, in a volume as large as our entire observable Universe. This was the requirement set by the European Euclid mission, whose main objective is to explore the dark side of the Universe.
Indeed, about 95 percent of the Universe is dark. The cosmos consists of 23 percent of dark matter and 72 percent of dark energy. "The nature of dark energy remains one of the main unsolved puzzles in modern science," says Romain Teyssier, UZH professor for computational astrophysics. A puzzle that can be cracked only through indirect observation: When the Euclid satellite will capture the light of billions of galaxies in large areas of the sky, astronomers will measure very subtle distortions that arise from the deflection of light of these background galaxies by a foreground, invisible distribution of mass - dark matter. "That is comparable to the distortion of light by a somewhat uneven glass pane," says Joachim Stadel from the Institute for Computational Science of the UZH.
This new virtual galaxy catalogue will help optimize the observational strategy of the Euclid experiment and minimize various sources of error, before the satellite embarks on its six-year data collecting mission in 2020. "Euclid will perform a tomographic map of our Universe, tracing back in time more than 10-billion-year of evolution in the cosmos," Stadel says.

  <p>From its dynamic atmosphere to its hidden depths, Juno reveals Jupiter as never before.
An artist’s conception of Juno in orbit around Jupiter.  NASA
Forget what you thought you knew about Jupiter. The first science results are in from NASA’s Juno spacecraft, currently in orbit around Jove. The findings were published in this week’s Science and Geophysical Research Letters today, along with a salvo of press releases.
For starters, there was this eye-popping, never-before-seen sequence of Jupiter’s aurorae, captured by Juno’s Ultraviolet Spectrograph. The long-tailed “comet” on the left is the footprint of an electromagnetic connection to the moon Io:</p>
</blockquote>

<p> 
Juno’s orbit takes it around Jupiter once every 53 days, from a perijove 2,500 miles (4,000 km) above the Jovian cloud tops, to a five million mile (8 million km) apojove out past the orbit of Callisto. Original plans called for Juno to enter a tighter, 14-day-long orbit around Jupiter, but NASA decided to keep Juno in its present initial capture orbit after a helium valve engine anomaly turned up during a course correction burn last October. Juno will complete eight more planned orbits and was granted a brief reprieve as its final disposal via atmospheric entry won’t occur now until July 2018.
Comparing Gas Giants
It has been a thrilling ride, as Juno scans Jupiter in detail from pole-to-pole once every pass in a whirlwind six hour science phase. Juno completed its sixth perijove pass earlier this week. Unlike what Cassini is seeing on its Grand Finale orbits around Saturn, however, the poles of Jupiter are chaotic and complex.

“We knew, going in, that Jupiter that Jupiter would throw us some curves,” says Scott Bolton (Southwest Research Institute) in a NASA press release. “But now that we are here we are finding that Jupiter can throw the heat, as well as knuckleballs and sliders. There is so much going on here that we didn’t expect, that we have to take a step back and begin to rethink of this as a whole new Jupiter.”

Thus far, Juno has delivered unparalleled views of Jupiter’s poles, revealing complex cloud festoons and enigmatic white ovals and cyclones the size of the Earth. Pioneer 11 in 1974 and the Ulysses flyby of Jupiter in 1992 provided the only other polar views of Jupiter, and these were from much greater distances.
Here’s a highlight rundown of the first science findings of Juno at Jupiter:

Atmosphere: Sounding by Juno’s Microwave Radiometer instrument points towards a robust cycling of the ammonia clouds shrouding the planet and an ammonia-based weather cycle extending deep below the cloud tops. This ammonia stream is evident racing around Jupiter’s equatorial belt — Jupiter rotates once every 10 hours, the fastest spin of any planet in the solar system — but Juno sees this ammonia belt extending deeper than expected, to a depth of at least 300 km. In fact, the main ammonia-rich plume near the Northern Equatorial Belt resembles a larger version of the Hadley Cell circulation seen in the equatorial regions of the Earth.
Just what powers the swirling storms near Jupiter’s poles, and why does the northern pole of the planet differ dramatically from the south? “We’re questioning whether this is a dynamic system,” Says Bolton in a recent press release. “Are we seeing just one stage, and over the next year, we’re going to watch it disappear, or is this a stable configuration and these storms are circulating around one another?”

Gravitational field: The orbit of Juno makes it an ideal platform to plumb the extent of Jupiter’s gravitational field, giving scientists a chance to understand the interior structure of the planet. By carefully tracking Juno’s motion, engineers back on Earth can detect minute changes in the planet’s attractive force on the spacecraft.
Previous models featured sharp demarcations between transition layers, with perhaps a metallic liquid hydrogen core enveloping a bizarre high pressure zone of helium precipitation. Juno’s preliminary findings, however, challenge this assertion and suggest instead a large but indistinct “fuzzy” core diluted with layers that are intermixing. Understanding whether or not Jupiter has a solid core is a key mystery in planetary formation.

Finally, Juno delivered another surprise. Jupiter’s magnetic field is not only almost twice as strong as expected in spots, but it’s not uniform. These results come from Juno’s magnetometer and microwave radiometer. Specifically, the field strength peaks near 8 to 9 gauss, nearly twice the expected 5 gauss. Earth’s magnetic field is a paltry 0.3 to 0.7 gauss: for comparison, a typical refrigerator magnet has a field of about 50 gauss, powerful over short distances. Juno also recorded variances in the magnetic field map surrounding Jupiter up to 2 gauss. This strongly suggests that the dynamo generating the field is relatively shallow, rather than the deep-seated engine driving the magnetic field emanating from Earth’s core.

Radiation: The mission has provided another unique plus, with spectacular closeups of aurora over both poles of Jupiter. Jovian aurora have been seen by the Hubble Space Telescope orbiting the Earth, and Juno has now chronicled these up close, along with the footprint of the powerful Io flux tube extending from the innermost Galilean moon. JunoCam and Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) are the prime instruments monitoring Jovian aurora.
Thus far, Juno has navigated through the intense radiation field surrounding Jupiter relatively unscathed. The main spacecraft bus is shielded within a sturdy titanium housing.
Juno is the first outer solar system mission powered by three solar panels instead on a plutonium-fueled generator. And those panels are huge, each 29½ feet (9 meters) long. Engineers noticed “flecks of light” traveling across Juno’s navigational star camera field of view, which were traced back to micrometeoroid impacts along its three huge solar panels. Like with LISA Pathfinder, researchers soon realized that Juno can also serve as a micrometeoroid detector, the largest ever flown.
But that’s not all that the star trackers saw. Gaze upon the Jovian ring system seen, for the first time, from the planet’s perspective:

More science is sure to come, as researchers analyze Juno data. We’ve got just over a year remaining to this exciting mission to unravel the secrets of the largest planet in the solar system.

  <p>(Vienna University of Technology) Certain materials can be used to rotate the direction in which the light is oscillating. This is known as a ‘magneto-optical’ effect. One variant of this type of effect has now been demonstrated at TU Wien for the first time. Rather than switching the direction of the light wave continually, special materials called ‘topological insulators’ do so in quantum steps. This could give us a new method to measure fundamental constants of nature.</p>

  <p>For the first time in the world, scientists have explored the magnetic field in the upper solar atmosphere by observing the polarization of ultraviolet light from the Sun. They accomplished this by analyzing data taken by the CLASP sounding rocket experiment during its 5-minute flight in space on September 3, 2015. The data show that the structures of the solar chromosphere and transition region are more complicated than expected. Now that ultraviolet spectropolarimetry, the method used in the CLASP project, has been proven to work, it can be used in future investigations of the magnetic fields in the upper chromosphere and the transition region to better understand activity in the solar atmosphere.</p>

  <p>There’s a lot happening in the world of blockchain, the sometimes hard-to-grasp disruptive technology. Jess McCuan, content creator-in-chief with Quid, whose software can read millions of news articles for collective intelligence, uses data-focused visuals to help others easily digest blockchain’s biggest news in the last year.
 
 
If you work in finance or own any bitcoin, you likely already know about blockchain technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But for those in neither category, here’s a quick overview of a year’s worth of news about blockchains, databases that essentially make records more verifiable and permanent.</p>

<p>For this analysis, we used Quid, software that searches and analyses massive amounts of data and then offers insight by organizing that content visually.</p>

<p>It’s been a big year for news about blockchain, heralded as a technology that will disrupt several industries beyond banking in 2017.</p>

<p>Last spring, the biggest headline in the blockchain world was that an Australian entrepreneur, Craig Wright, finally came out of the shadows and declared he was the creator of the cryptocurrency bitcoin (though plenty were skeptical). Then a massive security breach at the decentralized autonomous organization was such a blow to blockchain that journalists wrote about the event all year. Last fall Ripple, which develops a payment protocol and exchange network, announced it had raised $50 million and partnered with major banks. In the timeline below, we identified several other events that generated significant news volume.
A Quid timeline maps 3,409 stories about blockchain, colored by cluster, from global news sources between 20 April 2016-20 April 2017. In the graph above, Quid sampled the data to show which stories generated the most volume in relation to each other.</p>

<p>Sorting all that data into a network, major themes emerge. The theme that generated the most stories was contracts and regulation. These stories, which account for 10 percent of the network, include wide-ranging debates about blockchain, suggesting it fosters trust in certain contract-heavy areas of finance or, on the other hand, exposes financial markets to money laundering and terrorist financing.</p>

<p>Other important themes: blockchain’s effect on mobile payments, trade finance, and augmented and virtual reality. The more surprising themes and developments: some countries see blockchain technology as a way to cut down on voting fraud, and others, like Australia, are starting to incorporate blockchain into peer-to-peer solar power exchanges.
A Quid network represents data from 3,409 stories about blockchain, colored by cluster, from global news sources between 20 April 2016 and 20 April 2017.</p>

<p>Next, the major players in blockchain. At the top of the list: Blythe Masters, an economist and former JPMorgan Chase executive who’s now running the software company Digital Asset Holdings. Then Bryan Behlendorf, a former programmer who now runs the open-source project Hyperledger. Quid identified Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym of the bitcoin founder, and Craig Wright as two separate individuals, though Wright claims that they are in fact the same person (interestingly, the two entities appear in different areas of the network).</p>

<p>In a network of news stories that shows largely positive sentiment, skepticism about Wright and his claims is one of the few areas of negative sentiment.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Finally, we ran a search that combined both the words “blockchain” and “future” to see if the future of blockchain looks any different than the present.</p>

<p>In a network view, there were some notable differences, namely, the emergence of blockchain in sectors beyond finance. The future of blockchain appears to veer more heavily into music and the arts, where the technology helps musicians and others protect the copyrights to their work.</p>

<p>And in the future, it seems blockchain may also play a bigger role in healthcare and medical records, insurance and green energy.
A Quid network shows 1,675 stories about the future of blockchain, from global news sources between 20 April 2016 and 20 April 2017.
