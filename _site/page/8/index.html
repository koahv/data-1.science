#### Extract
>Even climate activists increasingly recognise that the lofty rhetoric of the global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, concluded in Paris over a year ago, will not be matched by its promises’ actual impact on temperatures. This should make us think about smart, alternative solutions. But one such alternative, geoengineering, is a solution that many people refuse to entertain. Geoengineering means deliberately manipulating the Earth’s climate. It seems like something from science fiction. But it makes sense to think of it as a prudent and affordable insurance policy. Climate summit after climate summit has failed to affect global temperatures for a simple reason: solar and wind power are still too expensive and inefficient to repl...

>A recent NASA study outlines possible dedicated missions to the "ice giant' planets Uranus and Neptune. The outer solar system's "twin" planets looked very different when visited by Voyager 2 during the 1980s. Uranus, spinning on its side, had a nearly featureless disk. But Neptune displayed numerous bright and dark cloud patterns, including a hurricane-like featured dubbed the Great Dark Spot. In 2003, NASA's Galileo mission came to an end by plunging into the atmosphere of Jupiter. Later this year, Cassini will follow suit, ending a decade and a half exploring Saturn and its moons. What's next for planetary exploration? Some researchers are pushing the next logical step: dedicated orbiters for either or both of the "ice giant" outer plane...

>Take 10 minutes with this article and become an eclipse expert for family and friends. Sure, you know the basic idea: A solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between you and the Sun, hiding part or all of the Sun from view. It’s weird, it’s unearthly, and it scared the bejeezus out of our ancestors who didn’t know what was going on. The stories they made up to explain eclipses were hair-raising. The drive to actually understand eclipses — well enough to predict them! — was one of the drivers of ancient astronomy, and thus one of the drivers for the whole idea of science itself. When the Moon casts its shadow onto Earth, people on the ground see the Moon eclipsing the Sun. The shadow's umbra is the dark central part where the eclipse is...

> With the new Ansible automation-based system, the Army has accelerated its pace of change by 75 percent. Upgrades that used to take a day can now be achieved with high availability in less than two hours, and can be scheduled after hours. Emergency patches that used to take approximately three days can be implemented in a matter of hours. Overall, delivering changes is now four times faster, on average, based on the British Army’s internal calculations....
