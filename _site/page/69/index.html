>The personal journeys of world-changing thinkers such as Leonardo Da Vinci are fascinating enough in their own right, but what happens when you track the paths of thousands of similarly influential individuals across space and time? A team of scientists have done exactly that, mapping the birthplaces and death sites of over 120,000 of history's most celebrated intellectuals from the past 2,600 years. The resulting 5-minute-long video — while it focuses primarily on the travels of European and American men — offers a great look at how human migration patterns shifted along with technology, and reinforces the enduring popularity of cities as cultural destinations across time. It's also got some surprises (guess which Southern state...

So on so forth until we reached little Pluto. So I ask, how big would our personal star look on all the planets? Including Mercury and Venus.&#8221; Answer: This image only covers the 8 large planets in our solar system. So naturally, Pluto, Ceres, Eris, Makemake or Haumea (or any of the larger KBOs, for that matter) aren&#8217;t covered. To answer that portion of your question, on average Pluto is about 39 times farther from the Sun than the Earth is.

With the brand new model B+, an enhanced version of the model B revision two, some of hardware has been relocated into a more logical and tidier layout. This is the first thing anyone will notice about the device and it&#8217;s probably got a lot to do with the new USB ports being very prominent and drawing a critical eye over the rest of the board.

>(Image via Lacza) Before we can answer the part about the big bang, we must first delve into the potentially speculative nature of time. Time, in essence, is a non-spatial dimension dealing with the concept of duration. From our perspective, time is a linear motion from cause to effect. But contrary to the Newtonian idea of time — where it is perfectly regulated and completely uniform — time is currently thought to be completely relative. On top of this, there is actually quite a lot of debate over what exactly time is (and even if it even exists at all). We do know that time and space are the principle concepts in our dimension (with three spatial coordinates and one temporal coordinate), so to ask, “what is time” without also asking, “w...

>Classically, light can be thought of in two ways: either as a particle or a wave. But what is it really? Well, the &#8216;observer effect&#8217; makes that question kind of difficult to answer. So before we get too far into it, what is the observer effect? Simply put, the observer effect is a principle that states simply observing (or measuring) something can change its value. This effect is vastly more important in quantum mechanics than in everyday life, though it appears in a great many places. This means that &#8211; like most things in the quantum world &#8211; the phrase “what you see is what you get” doesn’t really apply. Therefore measuring what light is, in a way, can defeat the purpose. However the observer effect does very nicel...
