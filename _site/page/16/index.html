>All over the globe, the urbanization of landscapes is increasing. 60% of the land surface which is expected to be urban by 2030 is currently not built on at all. How this will impact on biological diversity will only be apparent in retrospect. However, for most cities there have been systematic surveys of biological diversity, although only since the second half of the 20th century. Researchers have now revealed, on the basis of historical data, how plant diversity in the region of Halle an der Saale has changed in over 300 years of urbanisation, and have also made predictions about the future....

The map of dog breeds, which is the largest to date, unearths new evidence that dogs traveled with humans across the Bering land bridge....

>For the first time in over 130 years, the UK has gone a full day without using coal power. From around 11pm on April 20 to midnight on April 21, the nation’s electricity demand was met through other sources, including wind, solar, nuclear and gas. “To have the first working day without coal since the start of the Industrial Revolution is a watershed moment in how our energy system is changing”, said Cordi O’Hara, Director of the UK System Operator at the National Grid. While coal has been a cornerstone of the UK’s energy production since the early 1880s, its usage has fallen in recent years. In 2015, the polluting fuel accounted for 23 percent of the nation’s energy creation, but this figure had fallen to just nine percent by 2016. A combin...

#### Extract
>(Worcester Polytechnic Institute) Ecologists who study flowering plants have long believed that flowers evolved with particular sets of characteristics to attract specific pollinators. But a recent paper in the journal Ecology suggests that flowers visited almost exclusively by hummingbirds are designed not to lure birds, but to confuse bumblebees and cost them precious time. This extra cost leads most bees to seek nectar rewards elsewhere, thus enabling the plants to more effectively attract more efficient hummingbird pollinators....

>(Smithsonian) Millions of years before humans discovered agriculture, ants were farming fungus beneath the surface of the Earth.

This transition allowed the ants to achieve higher levels of complexity in farming, rivaling the agricultural practices of humans. Scientists report that this transition likely occurred when farming ants began living in dry climates....

>(Field Museum) Mountains, like rainforests, are hotbeds of biodiversity. But scientists aren't sure why.

But there was little hard proof supporting this hypothesis -- until now....

Higher amounts of methane are produced when plants are tougher to digest - an effect of a warmer environment. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, around 25 times better at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. More than 95% of the methane produced by cows comes from their breath through...

A couple of years later Bowen filed a patent for a new way of making sago (a starchy cake), vermicelli (noodles), and soy sauce from soybeans.
