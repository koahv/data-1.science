It’s the surefire highlight of any public star party, and you won’t find it at the eyepiece.
Folks are always amazed to see the International Space Station pass by overhead. There it is: humanity at its best, cooperating in space. And the good news is, the International Space Station (ISS) will be putting on its best performance of 2016 starting this week, as it reaches a stretch of full illumination throughout the length of its orbit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means we’re in for multiple visible passes of the ISS worldwide. The ISS leaves the dwindling shadow of the Earth later this week on Thursday, May 26th at 13:14 Universal Time (UT), and doesn’t enter it again until more than four days later on May 30th at 19:25 UT. This occurs twice a year within a few weeks of either solstice. The May through July season favors the northern hemisphere, and the November through January season favors the southern hemisphere.

In fact, you may just see the ISS more than once on the same night. The ISS orbits Earth once every 93 minutes at an altitude of 251 miles. For example, the United Kingdom, which sits along latitude 50° to 60°N, can witness four to five passes of the ISS in a single night. A UK satellite hunting friend of mine, David Daniels (@OzoneVibe on Twitter) has suggested we term this phenomenon a FISION (Five ISS Sightings In One Night).
Why the high inclination orbit? The station’s 51.65-degree inclination is a direct result of international cooperation and assures that spaceports worldwide have access to the ISS. The core Zarya module for the station was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan (46°N) on November 20, 1998. Back during the age of the space shuttle, you could tell when a shuttle was headed to the station by its launch azimuth — it would chase after the ISS up the U.S. eastern seaboard.
As a happy result of this high-inclination orbit, the ISS is routinely visible to more than 99% of humanity. The station reaches an elevation of greater than 10° above the horizon between latitudes 63°N and 63°S.
The ISS can shine at magnitude -5 when it passes directly overhead — brighter than Venus. Using 15x45 imaged-stabilized binoculars, I can just make out the beginnings of the structure of the ISS. Depending on its orientation, the station can look like a tiny box or a small glowing Star Wars TIE fighter on a good pass.

High Beta Angle Season Begins
NASA calls this time of year “high beta angle season,” referring to the steep angle between the station’s orbit and the Sun. Though good for groundbased observers, continuous exposure to sunlight (and heat) poses potential problems in space, so NASA typically feathers the giant solar arrays of the station to create artificial shadows and cool the station.
The best way to know when the station is visible is to utilize one of the many tracking websites or apps out there. The Heavens-Above website is a great standby, and now has an app available for Android. Iphone users favor ISS Spotter and ISS Detector, and NASA’s Spot the Station offers email alerts. And Sky &amp; Telescope’s Satellite Tracker and Transit Tracker tools will provide predictions for not just for upcoming passes, but for upcoming transits as well, such as when the ISS passes over the face of the Moon.
Be patient during your ISS vigil. The station will typically become apparent about 10° above the horizon under clear skies. The station will appear to move slowly at first, picking up speed as it passes directly overhead. This apparent change is an illusion, as the ISS is about 500 miles away when first sighted near the horizon coming at you, but only 250 miles away overhead. And remember, while aircraft generate their own blinking lights, satellites like the ISS are so high overhead, they shine via reflected sunlight that’s still passing over the curve of the Earth.
Looking for a challenge? Catching a transit of the ISS across the face of the Sun or Moon is fun to try. To do this, you’ll need to know when a given transit occurs from your location at an exact time. This might not happen right in your backyard — the path of an ISS transit over the Earth is only about seven miles wide — so be prepared to travel a bit. And keep in mind, the ISS crosses the 30’ span of the Sun or Moon in just over a second. Not only that, but in most instances, it’s invisible on approach. (The one exception is an illuminated pass of the Moon.) So timing is everything.</p>

<p>In addition to S&amp;T’s transit tool, CALSky also lists upcoming transits of the Sun and Moon by the ISS up to two days out and will generate email alerts for your location. But these predictions are subject to change: the station is periodically boosted using the thrusters of visiting spacecraft to combat atmospheric drag, and it occasionally carries out short-notice Debris Avoidance Maneuvers (DAMs) as well. These maneuvers can shift the prospective path of a transit at the last moment. Likewise, the orbit of the ISS evolves over time, and it generally takes a day or so for updates provided by the U.S. Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) to percolate out to all of the various tracking platforms. Advanced satellite trackers generally go to NORAD’s Space-Track site to get their orbital elements from the source.
June will also see busy times for the station. First, the next crewed expedition launches from Baikonur on June 24th, followed by a SpaceX Falcon 9 launch of CRS9 on June 27th. Then on July 7th, the Progress 64P resupply vehicle heads towards the ISS. It’s worth watching passes of the ISS right around this time, as spacecraft approaching and departing the station will appear as +2 magnitude “stars” following the same path. The most dramatic rendezvouses to watch were back during the U.S. space shuttle program, which ended in 2011.
Be sure to keep an eye on the sky in the coming week, as multiple ISS passes light up the night sky.

“So far the Standard Model seems to explain matter, but we know there has to be something beyond the Standard Model,” said Denise Caldwell, director of the Physics Division of the National Science Foundation. “This potential new physics can only be uncovered with more data that will come with the next LHC run.” The Standard Model contains no explanation of gravity, which is one of the four fundamental forces in the universe. It also does not explain astronomical observations of dark matter, a type of matter that interacts with our visible universe only through gravity, nor does it explain why matter prevailed over antimatter during the formation of the early universe. The small mass of the Higgs boson also suggests that matter is fundamentally unstable.
Gerald Hooft, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, said in an interview to Doha-based broadcaster Al Jazeera that China's proposed collider, if built, "will bring hundreds, probably thousands, of top class scientists with different specializations, from pure theory to experimental physics and engineering, from abroad to China". Chinese scientists have completed an initial conceptual design of a super giant particle collider which will be bigger and more powerful than any particle accelerator on Earth.
 
China is planning to build an enormous particle accelerator twice the size and seven times as powerful as CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, according to state media reports. According to China Daily, the new facility will be capable of producing millions of Higgs boson particles - a great deal more than the Large Hadron Collider which originally discovered the ‘God particle’ back in 2012. The first phase of the project's construction is scheduled to begin between 2020 and 2025
"We have completed the initial conceptual design and organized international peer review recently, and the final conceptual design will be completed by the end of 2016," Wang Yifang, director of the Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, told China Daily in an exclusive interview.
 
 

 
The institute has been operating major high-energy physics projects in China, such as the Beijing Electron Positron Collider and the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino experiment. Now scientists are proposing a more ambitious new accelerator with seven times the energy level of the Large Hadron Collider in Europe.
In July 2012, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, also known as CERN, announced that it had discovered the long sought-after Higgs boson－the "God particle", regarded as the crucial link that could explain why other elementary particles have mass－on LHC. The discovery was believed to be one of the most important in physics for decades. Scientists are hopeful that it will further explain nature and the universe we live in.
The high-energy frontier has traditionally had one primary goal, to probe directly any uncharted physics waters. This has translated into the gigantic effort to complete the unobserved elements of the Standard Model of particle physics as well as to search for for signs of physics beyond.These measurements form a solid base from which searches for physics beyond the standard model have been launched. Since the discovery of the Higgs in 2012, searches for supersymmetry and several signatures of possible new exotic physics phenomena have been developed, and new parameter space is being explored.
In 2016, the Large Hadron Collider, the world's most powerful proton smasher, is preparing for its biggest run yet which scientists hope will uncover new particles that could dramatically change our understanding of the Universe. Scientists had been gearing up to resume experiments at the LHC this week, but the plans were delayed after a weasel wandered onto a high-voltage electrical transformer last Friday, causing a short-circuit. CERN told AFP that experiments were now expected to get underway next week.
The LHC, housed in a 27-kilometre (17-mile) tunnel straddling the French-Swiss border, has shaken up physics before. In 2012 it was used to prove the existence of the Higgs Boson -- the long-sought maker of mass -- by crashing high-energy proton beams at velocities near the speed of light. (A proton-lead ion collision, shown below as observed by the LHCb detector during the 2013 data-taking period LHCb/CERN). The giant lab might prove the exotic theory of supersymmetry, SUSY for short, which suggests the existence of a heavier "sibling" for every particle in the universe. The unexpected excess pair of photons spotted last year could be a larger cousin of the Higgs, according to one theory.
While LHC is composed of 27-kilometer-long accelerator chains and detectors buried 100 meters underground at the border of Switzerland and France, scientists only managed to spot hundreds of Higgs boson particles, not enough to learn the structure and other features of the particle.
With a circumference of 50 to 100 km, however, the proposed Chinese accelerator Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) will generate millions of Higgs boson particles, allowing a more precise understanding.
"The technical route we chose is different from LHC. While LHC smashes together protons, it generates Higgs particles together with many other particles," Wang said. "The proposed CEPC, however, collides electrons and positrons to create an extremely clean environment that only produces Higgs particles," he added.
The Higgs boson factory is only the first step of the ambitious plan. A second-phase project named SPPC (Super Proton-Proton Collider) is also included in the design－a fully upgraded version of LHC.
LHC shut down for upgrading in early 2013 and restarted in June with an almost doubled energy level of 13 TeV, a measurement of electron volts.
"LHC is hitting its limits of energy level, it seems not possible to escalate the energy dramatically at the existing facility," Wang said. The proposed SPPC will be a 100 TeV proton-proton collider.
If everything moves forward as proposed, the construction of the first phase project CEPC will start between 2020 and 2025, followed by the second phase in 2040.
"China brings to this entire discussion a certain level of newness. They are going to need help, but they have financial muscle and they have ambition," said Nima Arkani Hamed from the Institute for Advanced Study in the United States, who joined the force to promote CEPC in the world.
David J. Gross, a US particle physicist and 2004 Nobel Prize winner, wrote in a commentary co-signed by US theoretical physicist Edward Witten that although the cost of the project would be great, the benefits would also be great. "China would leap to a leadership position in an important frontier area of basic science," he wrote.

<blockquote>
  <p>During two Martian years, Curiosity tracks seasonal patterns in local atmosphere, temperature, and maybe even methane. 
Curiosity measured seasonal patterns that show the local atmosphere is clear in winter, dustier in spring and summer, and windy in autumn. The visibility in Gale Crater is as low as 20 miles (30km) in summer and as high as 80 miles (130km) in winter. NASA / JPL-Caltech / MSSS
Last week, Curiosity completed its second Martian year, even though it landed in Gale Crater almost four years ago. Mars is much further from the Sun than Earth is, so the Red Planet takes nearly twice as long to complete one orbit around our star: 687 days to our planet’s 365 days.
For the past two Martian years, Curiosity has been busy collecting rock samples. Those have revealed that this part of Mars was once habitable. But the rover has also been measuring atmospheric pressure, temperature, and methane levels. These measurements show seasonal changes, much like Earth’s yearly rhythm.
Seasons, both on Mars and on Earth, happen because of the planet’s tilt—its rotation axis inclines 25 and 23 degrees from vertical, respectively. Mars also has a longer elliptical orbit compared to Earth, causing longer winters and shorter summers in its southern hemisphere.
Curiosity found that seasonal temperatures at Gale Crater follow a periodic pattern like we see in Los Angeles—though at much lower temperatures, as seen in this graphic chart. Temperatures in LA range from 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) in the summer to 50 F (10 C) in the winter. Curiosity’s Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) has measured variations in temperatures ranging from 60.5 F (15.9 C) on a summer afternoon to -148 F (-100 C) on a winter night.
The temperature on Mars and Los Angeles follows the same seasonal pattern: higher temperatures during the summer, lower temperatures in the winter. NASA/JPL-Caltech/CAB(CSIC-INTA)
The chart also shows seasonal patterns between water content and relative humidity. The air in Gale Crater is very dry, with water content around 40 parts per million (ppm). As a comparison, a typical reading on Earth might be 20,000 ppm. Curiosity found that during the southern hemisphere’s summer, relative humidity—a measure of how close water vapor is to saturating the air—is low. In the winter, even though there is little water content in the air, the temperature drops so much that humidity actually goes up to 70%.
On Earth, we associate humidity with warm environments, like Florida in the summer, but high relative humidity can also happen in the winter. “For a given amount of water vapor, the colder the air gets, the closer it is to saturating, and the relative humidity goes up,” says project scientist Ashwin Vasavada (JPL). Gale’s winter humidity is high enough that frost might form on the ground, but the rover hasn’t found any.
Curiosity also measured seasonal patterns between water content and relative humidity. The humidity is highest in the winter, even if there is low water content in the atmosphere. NASA/JPL-Caltech/CAB(CSIC-INTA)
Changing Methane Levels
Another interesting trend from the two-year cycle is the periodic methane levels. During Curiosity’s two Martian years at Gale Crater, it has also been measuring background methane levels using the tunable laser spectrometer in its Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) suite of instruments. In the rover’s first cycle, it detected a spike in methane to 7 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) in the local atmosphere. This sparked media attention, especially because methane’s existence on Mars was previously a controversial issue.
Methane is the most abundant hydrocarbon in the solar system, but it must be replenished—either by biotic or abiotic activity — because it is easily destroyed by sunlight’s ultraviolet rays. So when Michael J. Mumma (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center) and Vladimir A. Krasnopolsky (Catholic University of America) found methane on Mars in 2004, scientists met it with skepticism.
Once Curiosity landed, it began using the SAM instruments to analyze the Martian atmosphere and reported an upper limit of just 0.18 ppbv with an uncertainty of ± 0.67ppbv. Because the levels were so low, mission scientists concluded there was no trace of methane. But when the rover detected the 7ppbv spike during its first autumn, it confirmed methane’s presence in the atmosphere, though scientists are still not sure where it came from.
The methane measurements Curiosity has taken over the last two Martian years also show a “background” level that falls mostly between 0.3 and 0.8 ppbv and possibly follows seasonal patterns. The 7 ppbv spike happened for several weeks during the first autumn, so mission scientists checked carefully for a repeat spike during the second autumn. But concentrations stayed low.
“Doing a second year told us right away that the spike was not a seasonal effect,” said Christopher Webster (JPL) of the SAM team in a press release. “It’s apparently an episodic event that we may or may not ever see again.”
The mission continues to monitor methane levels, which appear to be even lower in autumn than in other seasons. If confirmed, the low autumn level could be a delayed reaction to summer’s high ultraviolet radiation.
Technological innovations, and Curiosity’s continuous measurements, have allowed scientists to resolve the methane controversy in less than a decade. Only time will tell what other seasonal patterns Curiosity finds.

Background While noise annoyance has become recognized as an important environmental stressor, its association to mental health has hardly been studied. We therefore determined the association of noise annoyance to anxiety and depression and explored the contribution of diverse environmental sources to overall noise annoyance. Patients and Methods We investigated cross-sectional data of n = 15.010 participants of the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS), a population-based, prospective, single-center cohort study in Mid-Germany (age 35 to 74 years). Noise annoyance was assessed separately for road traffic, aircraft, railways, industrial, neighborhood indoor and outdoor noise (“during the day”; “in your sleep”) on 5-point scales (“not at all” to “extremely”); depression and anxiety were assessed by the PHQ-9, resp. GAD-2. Results Depression and anxiety increased with the degree of overall noise annoyance. Compared to no annoyance, prevalence ratios for depression, respectively anxiety increased from moderate (PR depression 1.20; 95%CI 1.00 to 1.45; PR anxiety 1.42; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.74) to extreme annoyance (PR depression 1.97; 95%CI 1.62 to 2.39; PR anxiety 2.14; 95% CI 1.71 to 2.67). Compared to other sources, aircraft noise annoyance was prominent affecting almost 60% of the population. Interpretation Strong noise annoyance was associated with a two-fold higher prevalence of depression and anxiety in the general population. While we could not relate annoyance due to aircraft noise directly to depression and anxiety, we established that it was the major source of annoyance in the sample, exceeding the other sources in those strongly annoyed. Prospective follow-up data will address the issue of causal relationships between annoyance and mental health.</p>

<p>Studies in high-income countries have shown an association between heatwaves and hospital admissions for mental disorders. It is unknown whether such associations exist in subtropical nations like Vietnam. The study aim was to investigate whether hospital admissions for mental disorders may be triggered, or exacerbated, by heat exposure and heatwaves, in a low- and middle-income country, Vietnam. For this, we used data from the Hanoi Mental Hospital over five years (2008–2012) to estimate the effect of heatwaves on admissions for mental disorders. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression model accounting for seasonality, time trend, days of week, and mean humidity was used to analyse the relationship. Heatwave events were mainly studied as periods of three or seven consecutive days above the threshold of 35°C daily maximum temperature (90th percentile). The study result showed heatwaves increased the risk for admission in the whole group of mental disorders (F00-79) for more persistent heatwaves of at least 3 days when compared with non-heatwave periods. The relative risks were estimated at 1.04 (0.95–1.13), 1.15 (1.005–1.31), and 1.36 (1–1.90) for a one-, three- and seven-day heatwave, respectively. Admissions for mental disorders increased among men, residents in rural communities, and the elderly population during heatwaves. The groups of organic mental disorders, including symptomatic illnesses (F0-9) and mental retardation (F70-79), had increased admissions during heatwaves. The findings are novel in their focus on heatwave impact on mental diseases in a population habituating in a subtropical low- and middle-income country characterized by rapid epidemiological transitions and environmental changes.</p>

All life on Earth uses DNA to encode and store genes, and to pass them on from one generation to the next. RNA, a close molecular relative of DNA, is used within living cells to carryout a wide variety of important biological functions, including protein synthesis.
DNA and RNA are both extremely complex molecules, a fact that has fueled a long-standing debate about the origins of life. RNA looks potentially older and more versatile than DNA, so many scientists believe that RNA came before DNA. But did life begin with RNA, or was there something even simpler that preceded it?
Scientists have found it difficult to deduce the chemical environment on early Earth when life began. Nevertheless, there have been a number of notable successes in this area of research, including the discovery of reactions that produce the building blocks of RNA. However, a reaction that produces actual polymers of RNA has not been found, causing many scientists to conclude that RNA is the product of evolution.
“The origin of RNA is something I’ve been working on for two decades,” said Nicholas Hud, head of the Georgia Institute of Technology’s Center for Chemical Evolution, where researchers are attempting to figure out how life began. “It is easy to speculate that some other molecule came before RNA, but determining the structure of molecules that might actually have come before RNA is a major challenge for chemists.” (RNA world image below/NASA)
 

 
A recent paper by Hud and his team found that proflavine, a small planar molecule that binds between adjacent base pairs of a DNA, can dramatically increase the stability of DNA or RNA in the lab when single strands of the complex molecules are synthetically bound to an unnatural nucleic acid. (“Unnatural” means that these are molecules similar to natural DNA or RNA, but with different backbone structures.)
“Proflavine can cause the formation of a duplex from two nucleic acids that otherwise do not form duplexes at all,” Hud said. He added that their results are important for two reasons. The first is that duplexes formed by DNA and an unnatural nucleic acid could be used to create dynamic structures that assemble only when proflavine, or a similar molecule, is present. This property has potential applications in nanotechnology, or the technology of very small things.
A second and more fundamental implication of this work has to do with our understanding of the “RNA World” hypothesis, the theory that RNA was the first molecule of life. After decades of unsuccessful attempts to create RNA in model prebiotic (non-biological) reactions, many chemists that study the origin of life believe that there must have been some other RNA-like polymer before RNA. Hud said the first of these polymers could be called a ‘proto-RNA‘ and each evolutionary step between proto-RNA and current RNA is a ‘pre-RNA.’
“There have been many proposals for possible pre-RNA structures,” he said. “While it may not be possible to determine the exact structure of any of the molecules that served as the ancestors of RNA, researchers generally agree that the ability to form a duplex with RNA is an important criterion that must be met for a molecule to be considered a possible ancestor of RNA.”
Back in 2000 Hud and his collaborator Frank Anet proposed that small molecules might have helped the synthesis of RNA, or the original ancestor of RNA, if RNA came later. They called these hypothetical small molecules ‘molecular midwives,’ to reflect that these molecules would have helped give birth to RNA. They proposed that molecular midwives would have been similar to molecules that are currently known to bind DNA and RNA, such as fluorescent dye molecule known as “intercalators” that are used to visualize DNA in the laboratory.
Most recently, Hud and his collaborators have discovered that proflavine, a particular intercalator, is able to cause the formation of a double helix, like that formed by two DNA molecules, but between RNA and a non-natural RNA-like molecule that has a “backbone” structure distinct from RNA and DNA. In the absence of proflavine these molecules do not form double helixes.
This result has important implications regarding the origin of the first RNA-like molecules of life. In particular, the number of molecules that could have served as the first genetic molecules of life might have been much greater than previously expected if intercalator molecules we present on the early Earth. Hud notes that proflavine is not a potentially prebiotic molecule, but was used in their study as a model for the type of intercalator molecules that may have been available on early Earth.
Hud has spent years studying the potential role of intercalators in the origin of RNA. Very few studies have investigated the ability of intercalators to bind non-natural RNA-like molecules, and no previous studies had investigated the possibility that intercalators might allow RNA to pair with polymers that would otherwise be “incompatible” with RNA.
Connections made within the Center for Chemical Evolution (or CCE) allowed these studies to move to a whole new level. Ram Krishnamurthy, a fellow member of the CCE who is at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif., was synthesizing with his co-workers a polymer called iso-GNA that is in some ways simpler than RNA, and they thought this polymer might shed light on the structural requirements for the simplest informational system RNA. Their observation that iso-GNA has limited base-pairing with RNA made them question the currently accepted requirements for ancestors of RNA. Conversations within the CCE resulted in Hud’s group testing the ability of an intercalator to facilitate the pairing of Krishnamurthy’s molecule (iso-GNA) with RNA.
“In our earlier work on iso-GNA revealed that this molecule did not form duplexes that are stable as those of DNA or RNA,” Krishnamurthy said. “We proposed that this limitation of iso-GNA could be overcome by the use of intercalators since they are known to stabilize base-pairing within a duplex structure by enhancing base-stacking. What is fascinating in this study is that the increase we observed for the stability of iso-GNA duplexes in the presence of proflavine is much larger than the increased stability those observed when proflavine binds DNA or RNA, far exceeding our expectations. This study should allow for a greater flexibility when searching for possible prebiotic polymers that are able to interact with RNA (or DNA).”
These latest results have caused Hud and Krishnamurthy to broaden their view of which molecules might have come before RNA. These two researchers and their co-workers are currently trying to find a possible ancestor of RNA that is able to spontaneously form from molecules that were present on the early Earth. They remain more open than ever to the idea that some molecules not seen in life today may have been necessary to get life started, perhaps molecules that we could view as the “midwives” that helped give “birth” to RNA.
Funding for the research was provided by the National Science Foundation (which funds CCE more generally) and a grant from the NASA Astrobiology Institute element of the Astrobiology Program at NASA.

  <p>“There exists a passion for comprehension, just as there exists a passion for music. That passion is rather common in children, but gets lost in most people later on.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Reason is a tool, a machine, which is driven by the spiritual fire,” Dostoyevsky wrote in 1838 as he contemplated how we come to know truth.
More than a century later, Albert Einstein (March 14, 1879–April 18, 1955) examined the nature of the spiritual fire that fuels reason, which he called “a passion for comprehension,” in a 1950 Scientific American essay later included in Ideas and Opinions (public library) — that superb compendium that gave us Einstein’s abiding reflections on the value of kindness, the secret to his thought process, the common language of science, and his increasingly timely message to posterity.</p>

<p>Einstein, who first contacted that “passion for comprehension” in his formative experience with a compass, writes:
There exists a passion for comprehension, just as there exists a passion for music. That passion is rather common in children, but gets lost in most people later on. Without this passion, there would be neither mathematics nor natural science. Time and again the passion for understanding has led to the illusion that man is able to comprehend the objective world rationally, by pure thought, without any empirical foundations — in short, by metaphysics. I believe that every true theorist is a kind of tamed metaphysicist, no matter how pure a “positivist” he may fancy himself. The metaphysicist believes that the logically simple is also the real. The tamed metaphysicist believes that not all that is logically simple is embodied in experienced reality, but that the totality of all sensory experience can be “comprehended” on the basis of a conceptual system built on premises of great simplicity. The skeptic will say that this is a “miracle creed.” Admittedly so, but it is a miracle creed which has been borne out to an amazing extent by the development of science.
Complement the indispensable Ideas and Opinions with Einstein on science and religion, the secret to learning anything, growing old, his breathtaking love letters, and his magnificent letter of advice to Marie Curie on how to handle haters.
