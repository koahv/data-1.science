  <p>On March 17, 2002, the twin satellites of the NASA/German Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) were launched in order to make precise measurements of the Earth´s gravity field. GRACE has lasted three times as long as originally planned for more than 15 years. Now it has ended science operations. GRACE-2 is currently orbiting at 305.3 kilometers above Earth, 655 kilometers ahead of and 1,3 kilometers below GRACE-1. With GRACE-2 out of fuel, atmospheric drag on the satellite will increase the separation distance and lower GRACE-2’s altitude relative to GRACE-1. There is no risk of a collision with GRACE-1, and GRACE-2’s orbital altitude does not pose a hazard to other operational satellites. Each of the twin GRACE satellites operates by transmitting microwave signals that are received by the other GRACE satellite. The timing of the received signals is used to precisely measure the small accelerations and decelerations caused by changing mass on the Earth below the spacecraft, which alter the distance between them very slightly. GRACE’s monthly maps of regional variations in global gravity over the past 15-plus years have shown how water, ice and solid Earth material on or near Earth’s surface has moved.

  <p>Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation, while coronal mass ejections are massive clouds of solar material and magnetic fields that erupt from the Sun at incredible speeds. With multiple views of solar activity, scientists can better track the evolution and propagation of solar eruptions, with the goal of improving our understanding of space weather. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth’s atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground, however – when intense enough – they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel. On the other hand, depending on the direction they’re traveling in, CMEs can spark powerful geomagnetic storms in Earth’s magnetic field. Many observatories watch the Sun around the clock in dozens of different wavelengths of light. Each can reveal unique structures and dynamics in the Sun’s surface and lower atmosphere, giving researchers an integrated picture of the conditions driving space weather.</p>

  <p>One reason why testing quantum gravity is so challenging is that its effects appear only at very high-energy scales and their corresponding tiny length scales. These extreme scales, which are very near the Planck scale, are roughly 15 orders of magnitude beyond those accessible by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). “We expect the geometry of spacetime to be an emergent structure, which emerges from some purely mathematical theory of quantum gravity;” Mir Faizal.</p>

  <p>We now have abundant proof that quantum entanglement is possible. Entanglement describes communication of properties between particles that are separated by distance. Quantum computers handle and process information in a way far different from that of classical computers. Qubits are the quantum variety of classical computing informational placeholders - bits. Classical bits state either 0 or 1, whereas a qubit may be 0 or 1 simultaneously. This is called quantum superposition. Quantum computers will be capable of performing vastly more complicated computations than classical computers.</p>

  <p>Beyond Science Fiction In 1935, Albert Einstein famously collaborated with physicists Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen on a paper designed to illuminate the weaknesses in quantum mechanics, a branch of physics focused on the very small. Though the phenomenon of “entanglement” was so new the term hadn’t even been coined yet, Einstein wasted no time voicing his skepticism of it, calling the “spooky action at a distance” simply impossible. Nearly a century later, we now have abundant proof that entanglement is possible. In fact, we’re now on the brink of building the quantum computers that will allow us to use the phenomenon to answer some of humanity’s greatest questions. Quantum computers handle and…</p>

  <p>It is thought that anoxygenic photosynthesis evolved before oxygenic photosynthesis, playing a role in some of the earliest evidence for life on Earth, before the rise of atmospheric oxygen. Using a combination of comparative genomics and molecular clock analyses, researchers determined that phototrophic members of the Chloroflexi phylum evolved far too recently to have been the progenitors of oxygenic photosynthesis, a process that evolved about 2.3 billion years ago. In contrast, it was found that Chloroflexi did not predate the process at all, having evolved roughly 867 million years ago.</p>

  <p>Over two-thirds of the world’s pumpkins, squash and gourds are produced in Asia alone. The researchers sequenced the two different pumpkin species to better understand their contrasting desirable traits: Cucurbita moschata is known for its resistance to disease and other stresses, such as extreme temperatures, while C. maxima is better known for its fruit quality and nutrition. Cucurbitas have large genomes with 20 pairs of chromosomes, compared to watermelon’s 11 or cucumber’s 7. This was the first clue that the pumpkin’s genome had expanded a long time ago. By comparing the Curcurbita genome sequences to those of other cucurbits, the researchers discovered that the pumpkin genome is actually a combination of two ancient genomes, making it a paleotetraploid. Although the pumpkin is considered a diploid today, meaning that it has only two copies of each chromosome, the genome sequence analysis revealed that between 3-20 million years ago, two different ancestral species combined their genomes to create an allotetraploid - a new species with four (tetra-) copies of each chromosome, from two different (allo-) species.</p>

  <p>“When a gas molecule approaches a liquid surface at a distance of several to a dozen or so mean free paths, it virtually stops colliding with other molecules in its environment. At this point, a typical description of the phenomenon by means of thermodynamics is no longer sufficient. Near the surface of the liquid, energy transport takes place in a different manner, ballistically. The gas molecule simply takes its energy and hits the surface, sometimes several times,” says Dr. Marek Litniewski. During evaporation, the ballistic transfer of energy begins to play a role for gas molecules micrometers away from the surface of the droplet.</p>

  <p>Targeted motor and sensory re-innervation (TMSR) is a surgical procedure on patients with amputations that reroutes residual limb nerves towards intact muscles and skin in order to fit them with a limb prosthesis. TMSR changes the way the brain processes motor control and somatosensory input. A patient fitted with a TMSR prosthetic “sends” motor commands to the reinnervated muscles, where his or her movement intentions are decoded and sent to the prosthetic limb while direct stimulation of the skin over the re-innervated muscles is sent back to the brain, inducing touch perception on the missing limb. Ultra-high field 7 Tesla fMRI is an exceptional tool for studying the upper-limb maps of the motor and somatosensory cortex following amputation. The study also shows that there is a need of further engineering advances such as the integration of somatosensory feedback into current prosthetics that can enable them to move and feel as real limbs.</p>

  <p>Crisper Than CRISPR CRISPR-Cas9 has been widely heralded as one of the most important scientific developments of recent years, thanks to its capacity to make edits to the human genome. Now, a more precise version of the tool has been developed by a team of scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard. The human genome is made up of chemical bases that are referred to as A, C, G, and T. The new technique is called base editing, and it allows individual bases to be modified without causing a break in the DNA’s overarching structure. Sometimes, only one base pair in a length of DNA is abnormal in some way – this is called a point mutation, and it accounts for 32,000 of the 50,000 changes in the human genome that…</p>

Most mammals possess a gene known as UCP1, which allows an organisms to regulate its body temperature when it’s cold by burning fat–but pigs don’t. The scientists took the gene from a mouse and used CRISPR to introduce it into pig cells. These cells were used to create in excess of 2,553 cloned pig embryos.

On Tuesday, the Italian Industry Minister announced that by 2025, the country plans to phase out coal power plants. Additionally, the country plans to meet 27 percent of “gross overall energy consumption” with renewable sources by the year 2030. During a parliamentary hearing, Minister Carlo Calenda asked the national grid company to identify the infrastructure needed to make the transition. Shortly after, the country’s biggest utility, Enel, said it will not invest in new coal-fired power plants. Unlike other countries in Europe, Italy’s renewable sector is constantly growing.

  <p>A Tiny, Huge Discovery On July 4th, 2012, researchers from the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) made a big announcement. They had observed the Higgs boson, an elementary particle predicted by one of the best models for physics in the universe. “‘We discovered the particle that makes it possible for atoms to form in the first place.’ That’s much sexier,” James Beacham, a particle physicist at CERN, said of the discovery in an interview at Brain Bar Budapest, a future-oriented science festival in Hungary held in June. Those in the know might have been anticipating this observation for decades, but that didn’t dampen the excitement. The discovery marked the culmination of a 40-year scientific effort, as Beach…</p>

Her first book, Squid Empire: The Rise and Fall of the Cephalopods, chronicles the 500-million-year evolutionary journey of these fascinating animals. She also blogs at The Cephalopodiatrist. Giant squid are the sea’s best monsters, tentacles down. For evidence we need look no further than the logo of this very website. But did you know that our beloved Architeuthis descends from a venerable line of sea monsters—that Archy’s ancestors, in fact, may have been the first animals ever to merit the name “monster”? The phrase “prehistoric sea monster” might summon to mind an ichthyosaur or megalodon, but these are johnny-come-latelies…</p>

  <p>Limited Space in Singapore The city-state of Singapore has announced a plan to reduce the vehicle growth rate from 0.25 percent per year to 0 percent for cars and motorcycles. Due to the limited space available, Singapore controls the number of vehicles on the road to a great degree. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) issues permits, known as Certificates of Entitlement, that give vehicle owners the right to have their vehicle for a period of ten years. The permits are auctioned off. The last auction ended with the highest bidder paying $41,617 (US $30,533.39) only for the privilege of being able to operate the vehicle. The government cites the limited available land area as a reason behind the halt. The LTA stated, “In view of land c…</p>
