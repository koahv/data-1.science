>One reason why testing quantum gravity is so challenging is that its effects appear only at very high-energy scales and their corresponding tiny length scales. These extreme scales, which are very near the Planck scale, are roughly 15 orders of magnitude beyond those accessible by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). "We expect the geometry of spacetime to be an emergent structure, which emerges from some purely mathematical theory of quantum gravity;" Mir Faizal.

>"When a gas molecule approaches a liquid surface at a distance of several to a dozen or so mean free paths, it virtually stops colliding with other molecules in its environment. At this point, a typical description of the phenomenon by means of thermodynamics is no longer sufficient. Near the surface of the liquid, energy transport takes place in a different manner, ballistically. The gas molecule simply takes its energy and hits the surface, sometimes several times," says Dr. Marek Litniewski. During evaporation, the ballistic transfer of energy begins to play a role for gas molecules micrometers away from the surface of the droplet.

>A new evaporation dynamics study finds that very small droplets evaporate more slowly than predicted by current models. Researchers from the Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IPC PAS) in Warsaw, in cooperation with the Institute of Physics of the PAS (IP PAS),have described the course of evaporation of micrometer and nanometer-sized droplets. The result of the research, presented in the journal Soft Matter, is an equation that accurately predicts the course of evaporation for droplets of different sizes and fluids. The equation has many applications, including constructing more accurate climate models and designing more efficient internal combustion engines or cooling units....

>On March 17, 2002, the twin satellites of the NASA/German Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) were launched in order to make precise measurements of the EarthÂ´s gravity field. GRACE has lasted three times as long as originally planned for more than 15 years. Now it has ended science operations. GRACE-2 is currently orbiting at 305.3 kilometers above Earth, 655 kilometers ahead of and 1,3 kilometers below GRACE-1. With GRACE-2 out of fuel, atmospheric drag on the satellite will increase the separation distance and lower GRACE-2's altitude relative to GRACE-1. There is no risk of a collision with GRACE-1, and GRACE-2's orbital altitude does not pose a hazard to other operational satellites. Each of the twin GRACE satellites operates by transmitting microwave signals that are received by the other GRACE satellite. The timing of the received signals is used to precisely measure the small accelerations and decelerations caused by changing mass on the Earth below the spacecraft, which alter the distance between them very slightly. GRACE's monthly maps of regional variations in global gravity over the past 15-plus years have shown how water, ice and solid Earth material on or near Earth's surface has moved.

>Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation, while coronal mass ejections are massive clouds of solar material and magnetic fields that erupt from the Sun at incredible speeds. With multiple views of solar activity, scientists can better track the evolution and propagation of solar eruptions, with the goal of improving our understanding of space weather. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground, however -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel. On the other hand, depending on the direction they're traveling in, CMEs can spark powerful geomagnetic storms in Earth's magnetic field. Many observatories watch the Sun around the clock in dozens of different wavelengths of light. Each can reveal unique structures and dynamics in the Sun's surface and lower atmosphere, giving researchers an integrated picture of the conditions driving space weather.

>Targeted motor and sensory re-innervation (TMSR) is a surgical procedure on patients with amputations that reroutes residual limb nerves towards intact muscles and skin in order to fit them with a limb prosthesis. TMSR changes the way the brain processes motor control and somatosensory input. A patient fitted with a TMSR prosthetic "sends" motor commands to the reinnervated muscles, where his or her movement intentions are decoded and sent to the prosthetic limb while direct stimulation of the skin over the re-innervated muscles is sent back to the brain, inducing touch perception on the missing limb. Ultra-high field 7 Tesla fMRI is an exceptional tool for studying the upper-limb maps of the motor and somatosensory cortex following amputation. The study also shows that there is a need of further engineering advances such as the integration of somatosensory feedback into current prosthetics that can enable them to move and feel as real limbs.

>Crisper Than CRISPR CRISPR-Cas9 has been widely heralded as one of the most important scientific developments of recent years, thanks to its capacity to make edits to the human genome. Now, a more precise version of the tool has been developed by a team of scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard. The human genome is made up of chemical bases that are referred to as A, C, G, and T. The new technique is called base editing, and it allows individual bases to be modified without causing a break in the DNA&#8217;s overarching structure. Sometimes, only one base pair in a length of DNA is abnormal in some way â this is called a point mutation, and it accounts for 32,000 of the 50,000 changes in the human genome that...

But for Earth-observing satellites, the Moon serves as a crucial calibration source â and it's about to get an overhaul. The Moon doesn't produce its own light, of course: Its surface reflects the light of the Sun. But even though the Moon is airless and practically unchanging, not every lunar reflection is the same. The brightness of the Moon depends on the exact angle between the Earth, Moon, and Sun. For example, the brightness of a full Moon is usually quoted at magnitude around â13, about 14 magnitudes or 400,000 times fainter than the...

>Low-Fat Pigs Chinese scientists have successfully used CRISPR to create twelve healthy pigs that have around 24 percent less body fat than normal. The genetically modified low-fat pigs are still capable of maintaining a healthy body temperature, which could allow farmers to ensure the animals&#8217; welfare without spending as much money on feeding them and keeping them warm. Most mammals possess a gene known as UCP1, which allows an organisms to regulate its body temperature when it&#8217;s cold by burning fatâbut pigs don&#8217;t. The scientists took the gene from a mouse and used CRISPR to introduce it into pig cells. These cells were used to create in excess of 2,553 cloned pig embryos. Embryos were then implanted into thirteen pigs, t...

We see room for technologies that allow a team to collaboratively develop an application up to the point of implementing multiple screens and transitions, data entry and validation rules, conditionally shown components, simple workflows, and other standard interactions, *before* developers go into an IDE and start writing...

#### Extract
>Environmental pollution isnât just inconvenient &#8211; itâs downright deadly. Every year, more people are killed by pollutants â from toxic air to contaminated water â than by all war and violence. Pollution is also responsible for more deaths than AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined. This disturbing revelation was revealed in a new study published in the Lancet medical journal. Scientists determined that one out of every six premature deaths (about 9 million in 2015) results from pollution; and while life is more important than money, these deaths cause $4.6 trillion in annual losses or about 6.2 percent of the worldâs economy. Epidemiologist Philip Landrigan, lead author and Dean of global health at the Icahn School of Medicine in...

Hurricane Maria was particularly devastating for the more than 3.5 million American citizens living in these U.S. Caribbean territories. read more...

>New open data licenses make it easier for individuals and organizations of all types to share, analyze and use data collaboratively PRAGUE (OPEN SOURCE SUMMIT EUROPE 2017), October 23, 2017 â The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit advancing professional open source management for mass collaboration, today announced the Community Data License Agreement (CDLA) family of open data agreements. In an era of expansive and often underused data, the CDLA licenses are an effort to define a licensing framework to support collaborative communities built around curating and sharing âopenâ data.
