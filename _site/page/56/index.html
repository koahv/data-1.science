In the past, I've joined friends for a 3.14(ish) mile Pi Day run, visited a science museum (which included a pi exhibit) with my daughter, and simply indulged in a slice of Key Lime pie. This year, I give you the Opensource.com Pi Day special: 7 Raspberry Pi pieces: read more...

MMS will orbit Earth far beyond satellites to explore two different regions where magnetic reconnection often occurs, one on the day side (left box) and the other on the night side (right box) of Earth. Credit: NASA It’s the mission you might never have heard of. Even the name might leave you scratching your head. But with the goal of better understanding Earth’s space weather environment, NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission launched just over an hour before midnight on March 12th from Cape Canaveral on a worthwhile endeavor. The mission aims to provide a high-resolution, 3D view of magnetic reconnection in Earth’s magnetosphe...

>In 1941, Russian physicist Andrey Kolmogorov developed a theory of turbulence that has served as the basic foundation for our understanding of this important naturally occurring phenomenon. Turbulence occurs when fluid flow is characterized by chaotic physical changes. Kolmogorov's theory has been interpreted to imply that transitions from one state of turbulence to another must be a smooth evolution because very intense fluctuations that are part of the process itself would smooth out anything sharp. Now, however, a new experiment disproves this interpretation of Kolmogorov's theory....
