>Deadly Pollution We all know that pollution, in general, is harmful to human health. But a study published in The Lancet has shown the true magnitude of the threat. According to the study, in 2015, 1 in every 6 deaths around the world were caused by toxic air, water, soil, or workplace environment. That&#8217;s roughly 9 million people. To drive home the true weight of these figures, this means that pollution kills three times more people annually than tuberculosis, AIDS, or malaria. Of these 9 million annual deaths, 92% occur in less wealthy nations, signaling an obvious socioeconomic divide. Developing economies have the financial burden of fighting the causes of pollution (the welfare-linked costs of which are estimated to be roughly $4....
