>College Park MD (SPX) Jul 08, 2014 Theorists propose a way to make superconducting quantum devices such as Josephson junctions and qubits, atom-by-atom, inside a silicon crystal. Such systems could combine the most promising aspects of silicon spin qubits with the flexibility of superconducting circuits. The researcher's results have now been published in Nature Communications (1). High quality silicon is one of the histori...

#### Extract
>(Phys.org) —A team of researchers with members from the U.K., Germany and Bolivia has found evidence that suggests that parts of Bolivia now covered with rainforest were drier and more savanna-like just 2000 to 3000 years ago, a time when people were already living in the area. In their paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers describe how they took sediment core samples from lakes and noted large ditches dug by people that lived in the area during a time before the rainforests—their findings suggest such people adapted to the wetter climate over time, rather than moved into it and started cutting down trees, as has been suggested by other research....

>The theory on animal behavior for most of history was this: people think and feel; other animals do not. It's only in recent years that there's been a sea change in the field of animal cognition, where, previously, there was almost no field at all. As The New York Times Magazine reports, animals studied in zoos seem to contain an emotional spectrum that could populate "a veritable Russian novel." Research into animal behavior is suddenly less about "Can this animal feel?" and more about "What is this animal feeling?" The answer could be a dolphin seeing itself in a mirror, an OCD brown bear, or a depressed red panda that'll break your heart. Continue reading&hellip;...

>Eating fruits and vegetables is not often thought of as a "treatment." But according to researchers, there are more than 100 million people worldwide who have vitamin A deficiency, and for some of them, consuming fruits and vegetables is the most available treatment. That's because people in many parts of the world do not have access to vitamin supplements. Select fruits and vegetables contain carotenoids such as beta-carotene, also known as "provitamin A." Beta-carotene is the most potent precursor of vitamin A for humans (meaning the body breaks down beta-carotene into vitamin A)....

>       What we perceive as the big bang, physicists at the Perimeter Institure argue, could be the three-dimensional “mirage” of a collapsing star in a universe profoundly different than our own. Conventional understanding holds that the big bang began with a singularity – an unfathomably hot and dense phenomenon of spacetime where the standard laws of physics break down. Singularities are bizarre, and our understanding of them is limited. Our universe may have emerged from a black hole in a higher-dimensional universe, proposed a trio of Perimeter Institute researchers in the cover story of the latest Scientific American. “Cosmology’s greatest challenge is understanding the big bang itself,” write Perimeter Institute faculty member, Ni...

>Dark matter is a mysterious type of matter that doesn't interact with any form of electromagnetic radiation, i.e., light. It doesn’t radiate light, and light doesn’t bounce off it. Although we’ve never detected dark matter directly, a large amount of evidence points to its existence.Evidence for Dark MatterFritz Zwicky first proposed the idea in the 1930s, when he was observing the nearby and populous Coma galaxy cluster. By observing the light these galaxies emitted, Zwicky estimated the total mass of the cluster. But when he measured the galaxies’ velocities, Zwicky discovered that they were moving so fast that the cluster should have been breaking apart: the gravitational pull of its mass was too small in comparison.It seemed unlikely th...

With the brand new model B+, an enhanced version of the model B revision two, some of hardware has been relocated into a more logical and tidier layout. This is the first thing anyone will notice about the device and it&#8217;s probably got a lot to do with the new USB ports being very prominent and drawing a critical eye over the rest of the board.
