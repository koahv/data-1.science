Even modern techniques developed and employed since the 1960s cannot easily distinguish between channel networks generated randomly inside a computer and images of channels formed in the real world....

>(Naturalis Biodiversity Center) One of the riddles of mammal evolution is explained: the conservation of the number of trunk vertebrae. Dutch and American researchers show that this conservation is due to the role of speed in survival of fast running mammals. They measured variation of 774 skeletons of fast and slow species. The researchers found that a combination of developmental and biomechanical problems prevents evolutionary change in the number of trunk vertebrae in fast, but not in slow mammals....

Rootkits usually consist of a set of tools, to manipulate the Linux kernel, alter output to the screen or avoid some software from doing its tasks. Nowadays rootkits are less popular than they were before. One of the reasons is the increased security in the Linux kernel, making it harder to circumvent some areas (like using some system calls). Still they occur, or in a slightly different form. For example backdoors are still very popular. Often the attacker doesn&#8217;t even need full root access to abuse a system for other purposes....
