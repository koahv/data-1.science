<blockquote>
  <p>Wormholes, alternate universes, time warps — we’ve all heard crazy theories about what happens inside a black hole. So what’s the real story?
Artist’s illustration of the silhouette of a black hole surrounded by stars.  NASA GSFC
The short answer is, physicists don’t know.
A somewhat longer answer is, it depends on whom you ask.
What’s inside a black hole?
We basically understand what happens outside the black hole as you approach its event horizon, that infamous point of no return. The event horizon is where the escape speed exceeds the speed of light: you’d have to be going faster than light (which is impossible for any bit of matter) to escape the black hole’s gravity.
Inside the event horizon is where physics goes crazy. Calculations suggest that what the fabric of spacetime looks like inside a black hole depends on that particular black hole’s history. It might be turbulent, twisted, or any other number of things. One thing’s for sure, though: the tidal forces would kill you (see below).
According to theory, within a black hole there’s something called a singularity. A singularity is what all the matter in a black hole gets crushed into. Some people talk about it as a point of infinite density at the center of the black hole, but that’s probably wrong — true, it’s what classical physics tells us is there, but the singularity is also where classical physics breaks down, so we shouldn’t trust what it says here.
In a very specific mathematical case, the singularity in a spinning black hole becomes a ring, not a point. But that mathematical situation won’t exist in reality. Others say that the singularity is actually a whole surface inside the event horizon. We just don’t know. It could be that, in real black holes, singularities don’t even exist.
Wormholes are theoretically possible, given the right conditions. But those conditions almost certainly would never exist in the real universe.
What would happen if you fell into a black hole?
If it were a stellar-mass black hole, you’d be dead before you passed the event horizon. That’s because, if you think of a black hole as a pit, a stellar-mass black hole has steeper sides than a supermassive black hole. The tidal forces become too strong too fast for you to survive to the event horizon, resulting in your spaghettification (yes, that’s the technical term).
So let’s travel into a supermassive black hole. Passing the event horizon, you wouldn’t notice much (except some fun light effects and several extra g’s of gravity). But as you drew closer to the singularity, gravity should stretch and squeeze you as if you were dough in a bread machine. At this point you’d die.
What would someone watching see as you fell in?
As you approached the event horizon, a second person far, far away would watch your image slow down and redden. Theoretically, at the event horizon your image would freeze. But in practice you would disappear: the photons lose energy as it becomes harder for them to climb out of the black hole’s gravitational well nearer the event horizon, and their wavelength would increase until it grew past the observer’s detection capabilities — making the image invisible. So your image would redden and dim with time, until it faded entirely.

<blockquote>
  <p>Learn black hole facts, such as what we mean by “singularity” and “ergosphere,” and why we think black holes are real.
You can think of a spinning black hole as a cosmic whirlpool. Harry Clarke, from Edgar Allan Poe’s story “Descent into the Maelstrom” (1919) 
What is a black hole?
A black hole is a pit in the fabric of spacetime. Space and time, according to Einstein’s theory of special relativity, are interchangeable parts, or dimensions, of spacetime, much as width, height, and depth are dimensions of a box. Einstein’s theory is sometimes blamed for “making everything relative,” because it says the dimensions of space and time aren’t absolutes and can change, contracting or dilating depending on your frame of reference — effects only noticeable when dealing with strong gravity or relativistic speeds. However, that accusation is misleading, because units of spacetime are absolute.
In this wacky landscape, a black hole is a cosmic pothole. Black holes are places where the density of matter grew so high that the outward pressure of the matter’s particles couldn’t withstand the inward pull of gravity. So gravity, like a master poker player, gathered all the chips together and crushed them into what’s called a singularity. We don’t really understand what happens at the singularity; we only know that there, classical physics breaks down.
A singularity and a black hole are not the same thing. The singularity hides inside a black hole, screened from view by the black hole’s event horizon. The event horizon is the so-called point of no return: the region within which nothing, not even light, can escape the black hole’s gravitational pull.
However, this all becomes far more complicated if the black hole is spinning.
The Ergosphere
A spinning black hole is more like a whirlpool than a pothole. The swirling water in this analogy is spacetime itself. It’s pulled around as the black hole rotates. This region of twisted spacetime is called the ergosphere. It is impossible to stand still in this region.
A spinning black hole has kinetic energy bound up in its spin, in the same way that a spinning top is more energetic than a top lying down. That energy can be tapped into and transferred to other things in the black hole’s environment. (The term ergosphere comes from the Greek word for “work.”) Astronomers think that a black hole powers its jets with energy from its spin.
How Fast Does a Black Hole Spin?
When astronomers measure a black hole’s spin, they report the value as a fraction of the maximum allowed spin. For example, the bigger member of the black hole binary in the quasar OJ 287 has a spin, labeled a, of 0.313, or 31.3% of its max. But what does that mean?
This number is related to the black hole’s angular momentum; it’s not a fraction of the speed of light. But we can turn it into a fraction of the speed of light. S&amp;T readers are often no strangers to math, so here you go: the rotational velocity at the event horizon of a black hole is given by
where c is the speed of light. (The derivation is a bit messy; this equation comes thanks to Scott Hughes at MIT.) So for OJ 287 and its spin of a = 0.313, the black hole is spinning at 0.16c, or 16% the speed of light.
Do Black Holes Really Exist?
We’re pretty darn sure. Stars and gas at the centers of many galaxies orbit around invisible but incredibly massive objects, and we can tell how massive the object is based on these orbits: millions to billions of Suns’ worth of mass. No observers have detected surfaces for these objects. In addition, brilliant beacons called active galactic nuclei (the galactic-center kind of black hole) and X-ray binaries (the stellar kind of black hole) put out so much radiation — notably as jets — that the only explanation we’ve found that works is that these powerhouses are fueled by black holes.
Plus, the two gravitational-wave events recently detected by LIGO came from the merger of objects that look just like the black holes predicted by Einstein’s theory of gravity. In fact, black holes are an inevitable outcome of Einstein’s theory, a fact the famed physicist wasn’t happy about and actually tried — and failed — to disprove.
Could it be that we don’t really understand gravity, and something else explains all these phenomena? Yes. But so far no other ideas have worked out. And black holes work out really well. As bizarre as they are, my money is on their existence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>New results from NASA’s Dawn orbiter show that the largest asteroid (and acknowledged dwarf planet) must possess a global layer of water ice that lies just below its dark, dusty surface.
Even before NASA’s Dawn spacecraft reached asteroid 1 Ceres in March 2015, planetary scientists knew that this sizable world was not the dry-as-dust object that comes to mind when we imagine what asteroids should be like. For starters, it has a density (2.1 g/cm3) far too low for a solid ball of silicate rock. Infrared spectra taken as long ago as 1978 revealed the presence of water-infused clay minerals on its surface, and scans by ESA’s Herschel space observatory a few years ago even caught Ceres exhaling clouds of water vapor.
A comparison of hydrogen’s abundance near the surfaces of asteroids Vesta and Ceres. The vlues for Ceres, at least 100 times higher, imply that the hydrogen is bound into water — either in hydrated (clay) minerals or as water ice.NASA / JPL / UCLA / MPS / DLR / IDA / PSI
But one surprise from Dawn is that, apart from a smattering of bright spots here and there inside craters, there’s not a lot of ice actually exposed on the surface. Whatever ice Ceres has must lie deeper down.
Now, it turns out, “deeper down” is probably no more than 1 or 2 meters, and that water ice must be everywhere. As detailed in this week’s Science, the broken-up rubble on Ceres’ surface contains high concentrations of hydrogen — and, cosmochemically speaking, water ice is the only likely compound to account for all that hydrogen. In fact, as Thomas Prettyman (Planetary Science Institute) and his colleagues explain, the near-surface rocks contain up to 10% water by mass, and this global ice layer likely extends to great depth.
When a high-energy cosmic ray slams into an atom in Ceres’ surface, the target nucleus “explodes,” producing a spray of secondary particles, including neutrons. These particles can collide with other atoms in the regolith, creating gamma rays that escape with other neutrons from the dwarf planet and reach Dawn in orbit. S&amp;T diagram; source: T. Prettyman &amp; others
Dawn’s Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector (GRAND) slowly built up maps of neutrons and gamma rays escaping from Ceres as the spacecraft orbited. “Gamma rays provide a fingerprint of what’s in the surface,” Prettyman explains, because they’re the end product of complicated interactions of neutrons triggered by cosmic rays. Importantly, GRAND only detects neutrons and gamma rays extremely close to the surface, within about 1 meter.
The resulting maps show that the near-surface hydrogen is roughly 100 times more abundant than was found on 4 Vesta, Dawn’s previous host, which is largely covered with basaltic rock. On Ceres, the hydrogen signature is very uniform and increases dramatically toward the poles. The team interprets this gradation as a shift from minerals that reacted with (and incorporated) liquid water near the equator to near-surface water ice beginning at latitudes poleward of about 40°. There, Prettyman explains, water ice is probably filling the gaps between fine particles of dust.
This water didn’t come from impacting comets but rather must have been present when Ceres formed. Early in solar-system history, this body likely was at least warm, if not hot, due to the kinetic energy of near-constant bombardment and the decay of radioactive elements in its rocky matter, so the interior of Ceres separated into a rocky core surrounded by a less-dense exterior.
Planetary scientists think that Ceres has a large reservoir of water ice beneath its crust.NASA / JPL
It’s not clear how far this differentiation progressed. But it’s no great leap to imagine that Ceres once had a global ocean (or at least an outer layer of briny mud). Over time, sunlight warmed the equatorial regions enough to drive out the near-surface water and concentrate it at the poles.
Yet exposures of water ice aren’t common on the surface. Sure, there are some really bright spots in the big crater Occator, but those are likely salt deposits. (Last month the IAU’s Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature quietly announced that the bright spots inside Occator now have names. The main spot is Cerealia Fcaula, and the slightly less obvious ones to its east are collectively Vinalia Faculae.)
Dawn’s spectra suggest that water exists on the floor of a crater called Oxo and within some (but not all) of hundreds of polar craters that are persistently shadowed. These “cold traps,” explains Norbert Schörghofer (University of Hawaii), accumulate water vapor over time that’s been driven from Sun-warmed surfaces elsewhere.
So why isn’t Ceres icy white all over instead of the very dark surface (only 9% reflective) seen today? Here’s my guess: Ceres likely came together with a large helping of the kind of carbon-rich rock found in primitive, carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Every time something blasts into Ceres, it creates a plume of ejected debris that spreads outward and over the surface. It’s a mix of carbon-infused dust and water. Some of the water plops back onto the surface and eventually migrates toward the poles. But water vapor is vulnerable — ultraviolet sunlight readily breaks it down into hydrogen and oxygen — and so over time what settles back onto the surface becomes ever more desiccated.
That’s just my hunch, of course. What the new Dawn results do confirm is the longstanding prediction that ice can survive for billions of years just beneath the surface of a body like Ceres. And now there’s a much stronger case, Prettyman notes in a NASA press release, that near-surface water ice exists on other main belt asteroids.
To learn more, check out yesterday’s press briefing at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union, where Prettyman, Schörghofer, and others presented their results. And Marc Rayman, Dawn’s mission director, details all of the results from Ceres in Sky &amp; Telescope’s December issue.

  <p>Welcome to Mars: the European Space Agency’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter sets up shop around the Red Planet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first color image snapped by the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter of Mars’ moon, Phobos. ESA / Roscosmos / CaSSIS
There has been lots of news out of the ExoMars program in the past few weeks, including first views of Mars (and Phobos!) from the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), successful testing of a new NASA relay radio, as well as approval of crucial funding for the future ExoMars rover.
“We are extremely happy and proud to see that all the instruments are working well in the Mars environment,” says project scientist Håkan Svedhem (ESA) in a recent press release. “This first impression gives a fantastic preview of what’s to come when we start collecting data for real at the end of next year.”
Latest Phobos Views
As the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter calibrated its instruments on two looping passes of the Red Planet, spanning November 20th to the 28th, it also caught sight of another world: the innermost Martian moon Phobos. The Color and Surface Stereo Imaging System (CaSSIS) camera imaged Phobos from a distance of 4,800 miles (7,700 kilometers) on November 26th. Orbiting just 3,700 miles above the surface of Mars and measuring just 17 miles along its longest axis, groove-covered Phobos is most likely a captured asteroid. Orbiting Mars once every 7 hours and 40 minutes – closer than any other moon in the solar system — Phobos will probably crash into the planet some 30-50 million years from now.
The Mariner, Viking, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and Mars Express missions have also looked at Phobos up close. No mission has landed on Phobos as of yet, though Russia did attempt to send the ill-fated Phobos-Grunt sample return mission to the tiny moon in late 2011.
Settling Into Orbit
“This was just a ‘toes-in-the-water’ type exercise,” says project scientist Jorge Vago (ESA). “Over two orbits we exercised all instruments and acquired some data and calibration results. The coming year we will dedicate to slowly aerobrake the Trace Gas Orbiter into its circular, science orbit.”

The current elliptical orbit of the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter takes it around the Red Planet every 4.2 days, from a close periapsis pass less than 200 miles above the Martian surface out to a distant apoapsis of 60,900 miles. In keeping with Kepler’s 2nd law of orbital motion, TGO spends most of its time near apoapsis, while the crucial close in passes of Mars are fleeting.
The ExoMars mission will continue to perform checkout demonstrations of its instruments on each successive pass before settling down into its final near-circular science orbit around Mars just 250 miles above the surface late next year.
The main goal of TGO is to make accurate measurements of rare gases that constitute less than 1% of the tenuous Martian atmosphere, including acetylene, nitrogen dioxide, water vapor and, crucially, methane. The anomalous seasonal source of methane in the Martian atmosphere is controversial, as its source could be geological processes at work or (just maybe) life.
Radio Relays for Future Mars Exploration
NASA also has instruments aboard the orbiter. The twin Electra UHF radios aboard the spacecraft were successfully used to relay data from the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers during a recent periapsis pass on November 22nd. The ExoMars orbiter thus joins NASA’s aging Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), and MAVEN, along with ESA’s Mars Express, in the growing network of orbital relays circling the Red Planet. MRO, MAVEN, and Curiosity already employ Electra hardware, though the new orbiter’s package is expected to provide double the relay performance capability compared to MRO.

India’s Mars Orbiter Mission also entered orbit on September 24, 2014, and rounds out the orbital roll call around the Red Planet. Earthlings (or at least their robots) will continue their invasion of Mars in the coming years, as NASA’s Mars Insight makes the journey during the 2018 opposition season, and the United Arab Emirates’ Mars Hope, NASA’s 2020 Mars rover, and ESA’s ExoMars rover make the trip in 2020.
Meanwhile, some good news for ExoMars arrived recently back at Earth, as the joint ESA-Roscosmos mission received the 436 million Euros ($464 million) needed to complete the ExoMars project, including its rover set to launch in 2018. The recent failure of the Schiaparelli Entry, Descent and landing Module on October 19th left the future of the project’s rover in doubt.
ESA officials were careful to stress that Schiaparelli was a demonstrator only, and lessons learned will be applied to the rover landing. Findings from the Alenia Aerospace team investigating the crash of Schiaparelli suggest that it may have experienced a ‘1 second of terror’ error in its telemetry and, – thinking it was already on the surface — cut off its engines prematurely, plummeting at 300 kilometers per hour from a height of two to four kilometers to the Martian surface, creating a brand new Martian crater.
But such is the triumph and tragedy of Mars exploration. Expect more great views of Mars to come from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter.

  <p>Cassini’s final main engine burn this weekend sets the stage for a stunning grand finale.

After more than a decade exploring the ringed planet and its moons, NASA’s Cassini spacecraft is preparing for a daring set of orbits which will set it up for mission’s end later next year.
The recent 125th flyby of Saturn’s giant moon Titan (T-125) was the prelude to Cassini’s final acts, which will play out over the next year. That pass placed Cassini in a high-inclination orbit tilted 60° relative to the ring plane. Cassini will perform 20 passes just 620 miles (1000 kilometers) outside the F ring of Saturn in a phase known as the Ring-Grazing Orbits, which runs from late November 2016 through April 2017.

Cassini already reached apoapse, or its farthest point from Saturn, on Wednesday, November 30th. The first ring crossing is coming right up this weekend on Sunday, December 4th, at 7:09 a.m. EST / 13:09 UT. During the first periapse pass on Sunday, Cassini will also burn its main engine for the 183rd and final time for the mission. All later fine course corrections will be made using thrusters only.
Things get even more interesting after April, when the series of Grand Finale Orbits will begin, taking the spacecraft through the 1240-mile-wide (2000-kilometer-wide) gap between the planet’s cloud tops and rings for 22 final orbits. The Grand Finale Orbits start with the spacecraft’s 126th and final pass near Titan, which will set the spacecraft up for much tighter final orbits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a mission spanning two full decades, Cassini is scheduled to burn up in Saturn’s atmosphere on September 15th, 2017.
Saturn’s Science Closeup
The interesting science returns will come from observations of the F  and outer A rings. “The F-ring is amazing,” says Cassini project scientist Linda Spilker (Jet Propulsion Laboratory). “500 kilometers wide, this ring is ever-changing with bright streamers and tenuous filaments sometimes flowing out from it. At other times, the moon Prometheus dips in and out of the F ring, creating channels in the ring material.”
Three new science campaigns will get underway this weekend:</p>

<p>Measurement of Saturn’s magnetic and gravitational fields to probe the planet’s internal structure and rotation rate;
An evaluation on the total mass of the planet’s ring system in an effort to determine its age;
And finally, an analysis on the innermost radiation belts and possible direct sampling of the ring particles and Saturn’s upper atmosphere.</p>

Cassini’s Radio Science package will transmit towards Earth during each plane crossing, providing a long sweeping profile on each occultation pass. The spacecraft will also get great views of Saturn’s poles, including the strange hexagon feature that graces the planet’s north pole. Cassini’s Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer is set to chronicle its nine-hour passage over the north pole, giving us unparalleled views. Cassini will also measure the upper boundaries of Saturn’s atmosphere in preparation for direct sampling on final passes late next year.
Cassini will target Saturn’s moons as well. Expect to see closeups of the active ice geysers dotting the south pole of Enceladus one more time. Cassini will also image red-striped Tethys and the tiny shepherd moons Pan, Pandora, Atlas, and Daphnis, giving us the best views of these worldlets yet. Flybys of Pan and Daphnis occur in January and March respectively, from about 22,000 kilometers away.

And speaking of moons, Cassini will be on the lookout for structures in the rings known as propellers, which betray the presence on tiny moons braiding and disrupting the rings. Scientists have named some of the propellers discovered so far after famous aviators, such as Amelia Earhart.
Cassini: Decades of Exploration
Launched atop a Titan IV rocket on October 15, 1997, Cassini arrived at Saturn on July 1, 2004 after a slingshot maneuver past Venus, Earth and Jupiter. The mission also delivered the European Space Agency’s Huygens lander to Titan, which performed the most distant landing ever on January 14, 2005.
Powered by a plutonium-238 fueled Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG), Cassini has delivered some amazing science.
“Two of Cassini’s most astonishing discoveries are the global liquid water ocean on Enceladus, with possible hydrothermal vents on its seafloor which point to an ocean that may be habitable,” says Spilker. “The second is the lakes and seas of liquid methane at Titan’s north pole and the incredibly Earth-like surface that we see on Titan.”
So enjoy this final year at Saturn: there isn’t another mission to the ringed planet in the planetary exploration pipeline. The concept of a floating Titan Mare Explorer (TiME) was in the running during the last 2011 Planetary Decadal Survey, but never made it past the proposal stage.
It’ll be a long time before we visit Saturn again.

<blockquote>
  <p>When the first group of American astronauts started training for space flight in the 1950s, Air Force doctors put them through a number of wrenching trials. In one, they had to endure many multiples of the force of gravity we experience at sea level — or G-force. John Glenn experienced 7.9 Gs during his first orbital flight, and others briefly went as high as 32 Gs on Houston’s infamous G Machine. “You couldn’t lift your arm out of the couch above about 6 or 7 Gs,” Glenn told a historian. “Beyond that you were just supported there.”
But all of those numbers pale in comparison with a new kind of G Machine ­— GE’s computed tomography scanner called Revolution CT. Rather than preparing humans for exploring the universe, doctors use it to look inward and probe the mysteries of the body. One of its key imaging components — which weighs about 100 pounds — routinely reaches 70 Gs as it circles around patients lying inside the machine’s gantry up to five times per second.
The machine is currently on display at  annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) in Chicago, a “Grand Slam” trade show and gathering for radiologists. It is expected to draw 60,000 visitors and exhibitors this year.
All that speed—combines with “intelligent” motion correction—allows doctors to image the heart in just one heartbeat, among other things. But it also makes the spinning part — which includes an X-ray tube, a detector and a high-voltage transformer supplying them with power — accelerate so fast that it weighs the equivalent of 3.5 tons. “We designed the parts to survive much larger acceleration than astronauts experience in space,” says Hervé Blanc, a GE Healthcare engineer managing the team that designed the CT scanner’s high-voltage generators.
We talked to Blanc about the design during a recent visit to his office in Buc, France. Here’s the edited version of our conversation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GE Reports: Why does the X-ray tube move so fast?
Herve Blanc: You have to complete one full rotation on the gantry around the body in one heartbeat in order to get a clear and detailed image of the heart. That’s about five rotations per second. CT images the body one slice after another. At this speed and power, we can obtain 512 slices per second. As you can imagine, more slices generally mean a better image quality.
GER: What is a gantry?
HB: The gantry is the donut-like shape when you look at the machine. The gantry of the Revolution CT machine has a diameter of about 80 centimeters. As I said, the X-ray tube and the other parts attached to the gantry ride on it and can complete five rotations per second. When you do the math, you get into the space program territory.
GER: What kind of materials do you use?
HB: We work with aerospace-grade aluminum, but the material is just one element of the design. There is a system of springs that absorb the acceleration and make sure parts like the electronic board inside the detector do not move. We also included fail-safe design features. The 100-pound box that rotates around the gantry is attached with screws and also a dovetail lock. It’s a double system of safety. In case the screws break, the rail will hold it back.
GER: How do you test 70 Gs?
HB: We use a centrifuge. Actually, 70 Gs is what you experience in normal operations. In testing, we go much higher than that. We want the parts survive much higher accelerations.</p>

<p>GER: How do you supply power to a machine that’s zipping five times a second a around a 3-foot donut?
HB: Old-school CT scanners used brushes to transmit power. But when you increase the speed, you run into wear and reliability issues. We use contactless transmission — induction — to send power to the machine and collect the imaging signal from it.
GER: How much power?
HB: A basic CT uses 24 kilowatts and generates eight image slices per second. Revolution CT uses 100 kilowatts or more and gives us 512 slices. This allows us to image moving parts like the heart.</p>

<p>GER: What else can it do?
HB: The design allows us to change the energy of the imaging spectrum during a scan. When we then process the images with a special algorithm, we can see the composition of the body.
GER: How? Can you explain that?
HB: It is as if you were looking at a scenery with a pair of red glasses and then a pair of green glasses. By combining the information from both you can calculate the colors in the image. During CT imaging, soft tissues that contain water do not behave the same way as bones. By changing the energy spectrum — the color of your glasses, if you will — you are able to add another dimension to your pictures that describes the material content of the body. The software knows exactly with what energy you acquired the image. It has a physical model of energy absorption and is able to recognize the material it’s looking at.</p>

<p>GER: What are you working on right now?
HB: The Revolution CT has already allowed us to increase the quality of the images and reduce the amount of radiation at the same time. This is obviously good for the patients and helpful for doctors. We are now trying to develop the ultimate generator that would let us see exactly what we want in terms of the quantity and quality per image, and reduce radiation even more compared with today’s already good performance.</p>
