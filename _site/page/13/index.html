Artist's illustration of the silhouette of a black hole surrounded by stars. NASA GSFC The short answer is, physicists don’t know. A somewhat longer answer is, it depends on whom you ask. What's inside a black hole? We basically understand what happens outside the black hole as you approach its event horizon, that infamous point of no return. The event horizon is where the escape speed exceeds the speed of light: you’d have to be going faster than light (which is impossible for any bit of matter) to escape the black hole’s gravity. Inside the event horizon is where physics goes crazy. Calculations su...

Harry Clarke, from Edgar Allan Poe's story "Descent into the Maelstrom" (1919) What is a black hole? A black hole is a pit in the fabric of spacetime. Space and time, according to Einstein’s theory of special relativity, are interchangeable parts, or dimensions, of spacetime, much as width, height, and depth are dimensions of a box. Einstein’s theory is sometimes blamed for “making everything relative,” because it says the dimensions of space and time aren’t absolutes and can change, contracting or dilating depending on your frame of reference — effects only not...

#### Extract
>New results from NASA's Dawn orbiter show that the largest asteroid (and acknowledged dwarf planet) must possess a global layer of water ice that lies just below its dark, dusty surface. Even before NASA's Dawn spacecraft reached asteroid 1 Ceres in March 2015, planetary scientists knew that this sizable world was not the dry-as-dust object that comes to mind when we imagine what asteroids should be like. For starters, it has a density (2.1 g/cm3) far too low for a solid ball of silicate rock. Infrared spectra taken as long ago as 1978 revealed the presence of water-infused clay minerals on its surface, and scans by ESA's Herschel space observatory a few years ago even caught Ceres exhaling clouds of water vapor. A comparison of hydrogen's...
