>Researchers have developed a new method for measuring the mass of pulsars - highly magnetized rotating neutron stars formed from the remains of massive stars after they explode into supernovae. Until now, scientists have determined the mass of stars, planets and moons by studying their motion in relation to others nearby, using the gravitational pull between the two as the basis for their calculations. However, in the case of young pulsars, mathematicians have now found a new way to measure their mass, even if a star exists on its own in space....

Many New Horizons scientists expected Charon to be a monotonous, crater-battered world; instead, they’re finding a landscape covered with mountains, canyons, landslides, surface-color variations and more. “We thought the probability of seeing such interesting features on this satellite of a world at the far edge of our solar system was low,” said Ross Beyer, an affiliate of the New Horizons Geology, Geophysics and Imaging (GGI)...

While the fleshy living part of the snail remains undiscovered, the smallest of the species has been dubbed Angustopila dominikae after one of the study’s author’s wife, with it measuring just 0.86mm in height. Publishing its findings on ZooKeys, the team also discovered slightly larger species such as the Angustopila subelevata measuring in at 0.87mm. Angustopila dominikae, in the eye of a sewing needle.
