>This week we will be delving into systems and architectures designed for machine learning, but since it’s Monday and there is quite a bit to come, it seemed worthwhile to take a step back and consider how architects and software developers are thinking about the current landscape. With everyone from Intel touting the next generation deep learning and machine learning as a partial basis for their Altera buy, to webscale companies like Microsoft, Google, Baidu and others seeking ways to boost machine learning algorithms with hardware, accelerator, and of course, software approaches, the larger conversations tend to get lost in &#8230; The Theoretical Underbelly of Optimizing Machine Learning Systems was written by Nicole Hemsoth at The Platf...

About 7.5 billion years ago, astronomers observe the effects of a mysterious force that causes galaxies to fly apart at a faster rate. NASA / WMAP One of the most bizarre discoveries of the 21st century was that the universe is expanding at an accelerating speed. The culprit behind this ramp-up, called dark energy for lack of a better term, is an unknown force that’s pushing the universe’s expansion so that as cosmic time goes on, galaxies fly faster and faster apart.

And from their findings posted in the journal Diversity and Distributions, it appears that Europe, in particular, has been the most devastated by human activity, with many native mammal species wiped out over the last few thousand years. According to the news release on the findings, northern Europe without humans would not only be home to vast quantities of wolves, elks and bears, but would also likely have seen the immigration of faraway animals like the elephant or the rhinoceros.

Affecting more than 500 million people worldwide, obesity costs at least $200 billion each year in the United States alone, and contributes to potentially fatal disorders such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. Scientists have now revealed the mechanism underlying the genomic region most strongly associated with obesity. The findings uncover a genetic circuit that controls whether our bodies burn or store fat. Manipulating that genetic circuit may offer a new approach for obesity treatments....

After all, it&#8217;s not like there is a great cosmic radar that we can look at in order to clock our speed. It may seem like a rather difficult question to answer, but really, it only requires a little knowledge of geometry. To begin with, we know that the Earth completes one orbit every 365 days. Well, technically, a year is just a little longer than this. In truth, a years is actually 365.25 days long. That&#8217;s why, every four years, we have an extra day (we&#8217;re playing a bi...
