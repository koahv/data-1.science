The researchers believe targeting multiple viral DNA regions may be necessary for the potential antiviral aspect of CRISPR/Cas9 to be effective....

Technologies to repair cognition have been more elusive. That's rapidly changing with tools -- from fully implantable brain devices to neuron-eavesdropping grids atop the brain -- to directly probe the mind. These technologies, presented at the CNS conference in New York, are mapping new understandings of cognition and advancing efforts to improve memory in patients with cognitive deficits....

#### Extract
>Scientists have invented a new way to read and interpret the human genome. The computational method, called TargetFinder, can predict where non-coding DNA -- the DNA that does not code for proteins -- interacts with genes. This technology helps researchers connect mutations in the so-called genomic 'dark matter' with the genes they affect, potentially revealing new therapeutic targets for genetic disorders....

The study, published March 31 in Cell Host & Microbe, could help in the prediction of future viral outbreaks....
