>(Vienna University of Technology) Certain materials can be used to rotate the direction in which the light is oscillating. This is known as a 'magneto-optical' effect. One variant of this type of effect has now been demonstrated at TU Wien for the first time. Rather than switching the direction of the light wave continually, special materials called 'topological insulators' do so in quantum steps. This could give us a new method to measure fundamental constants of nature....

They ported games to Linux for these bundles too, so they did a lot of good work for us as well as for charity. The first bundle arrived on the 4th of May, 2010 featuring titles like World of Goo, Gish, LagaruHD and more.

However, combining quantum mechanics and Einstein's theory of general relativity theoretical physicists from the University of Vienna and the Austrian Academy of Sciences have demonstrated a fundamental limitation for our ability to measure time. The more precise a given clock is, the more it "blurs" the flow of time measured by neighbouring clocks. As a consequence, the time shown by the clocks is no longer well defined.

>(University of Ottawa) As we saw during the 2016 US election, protecting traditional computer systems, which use zeros and ones, from hackers is not a perfect science. Now consider the complex world of quantum computing, where bits of information can simultaneously hold multiple states beyond zero and one, and the potential threats become even trickier to tackle. Researchers at the University of Ottawa have uncovered clues that could help administrators protect quantum computing networks from external attacks....

>(Institute of Science and Technology Austria) A group of scientists led by Johannes Fink from the Institute of Science and Technology Austria reported the first experimental observation of a first-order phase transition in a dissipative quantum system. Phase transitions are something we often encounter in everyday life, for example when watching the freezing of water. But they also occur at the quantum mechanical level, where they are -- in spite of their importance for various fields of physics -- relatively unexplored....
