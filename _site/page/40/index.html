>The world’s largest offshore wind energy converter has been dubbed the DolWin beta by its producers ABB – which has offices in Ireland – and is being towed out to its new home in the North Sea. The company says the gargantuan converter station has a 916MW power transmission capacity, making it the world&#8217;s most powerful installation of its kind, producing enough energy to power more than 1m households with clean energy. Measuring 100m tall and long by 70m in width, the station is part of the DolWin2 project and will connect offshore wind farms in the North Sea’s DolWin cluster, currently the largest offshore wind farm cluster worldwide, with the German power grid. Its main purpose will be to convert the electricity generated by the of...

We’ve known for a while that human DNA holds about 20,000 human genes that code for proteins.

>       Gravity, one of the four fundamental forces of nature, is a fundamental constant of physics, so it is important to test this basic assumption using objects at different places, times, and gravitational conditions. The fact that we see gravity perform the same in our Solar System as it does in a distant star system helps to confirm that the gravitational constant truly is universal, according to a decades-long study of a distant pulsar by the Green Bank Telescope and the Arecibo Observatory. Astronomers using the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia and its Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico conducted a 21-year study to precisely measure the steady "tick-tick-tick" of a pulsar known as P...
