Now University of Rochester physicists have shown that a technique called compressive sensing also offers a way to measure both variables at the same time, without violating the Uncertainty Principle....

But although the weight of evidence continues to build, undisputed confirmation of their existence still eludes scientists.

So many different aspects of our understanding of the universe comes from this one constant. If the speed of light wasn&#8217;t constant, GPS systems wouldn&#8217;t work, and we wouldn&#8217;t be able to determine the age of distant galaxies in the universe. Most of Einstein&#8217;s equations would fall apart without a constant speed of light; time dilation and , the mass-energy relationship would fluctuate and quantum fluctuations on the Plank scale could potentially have large scale effects.
