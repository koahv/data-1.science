  <p>Scientists have revealed never-before-seen details of how our brain sends rapid-fire messages between its cells. They mapped the 3-D atomic structure of a two-part protein complex that controls the release of signaling chemicals, called neurotransmitters, from brain cells. Understanding how cells release those signals in less than one-thousandth of a second could help launch a new wave of research on drugs for treating brain disorders.</p>

  <p>One of the most common questions I’m asked by a disabled prospective Linux user is, “There are so many different Linux distributions. Which one is for me? Which one is most accessible?”
This is a valid question, and one that hasn’t been answered very often. Fortunately, like many things with Linux, there are ready-made solutions that will meet most users needs, and they’re all just a download away. In this article, I’ll explain how to install Linux and give a review of eight accessible Linux distributions, or distros as they are commonly called.

  <p>I recently came across a wiki page
written by Herman Brule
which gives a quick benchmark on a couple of compression methods / algorithms.
It gave me the idea of writing a quick script that tests out a wide number of
compression utilities available in Gentoo (usually through the app-arch
category), with also a number of options (in case multiple options are
possible).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The currently supported packages are:
app-arch/bloscpack      app-arch/bzip2          app-arch/freeze
app-arch/gzip           app-arch/lha            app-arch/lrzip
app-arch/lz4            app-arch/lzip           app-arch/lzma
app-arch/lzop           app-arch/mscompress     app-arch/p7zip
app-arch/pigz           app-arch/pixz           app-arch/plzip
app-arch/pxz            app-arch/rar            app-arch/rzip
app-arch/xar            app-arch/xz-utils       app-arch/zopfli
app-arch/zpaq</p>

<p>The script should keep the best compression information: duration, compression
ratio, compression command, as well as the compressed file itself.
Finding the “best” compression
It is not my intention to find the most optimal compression, as that would
require heuristic optimizations (which has triggered my interest in seeking
such software, or writing it myself) while trying out various optimization
parameters.
No, what I want is to find the “best” compression for a given file, with “best”
being either</p>

<p>most reduced size (which I call compression delta in my script)
best reduction obtained per time unit (which I call the efficiency)</p>

<p>For me personally, I think I would use it for the various raw image files that
I have through the photography hobby. Those image files are difficult to
compress (the Nikon DS3200 I use is an entry-level camera which applies
lossy compression already for its raw files) but their total size is considerable,
and it would allow me to better use the storage I have available both on my
laptop (which is SSD-only) as well as backup server.
But next to the best compression ratio, the efficiency is also an important
metric as it shows how efficient the algorithm works in a certain time aspect.
If one compression method yields 80% reduction in 5 minutes, and another one
yields 80,5% in 45 minutes, then I might want to prefer the first one even
though that is not the best compression at all.
Although the script could be used to get the most compression (without
resolving to an optimization algorithm for the compression commands) for 
each file, this is definitely not the use case. A single run can take hours
for files that are compressed in a handful of seconds. But it can show the
best algorithms for a particular file type (for instance, do a few runs on
a couple of raw image files and see which method is most succesful).
Another use case I’m currently looking into is how much improvement I can
get when multiple files (all raw image files) are first grouped in a single
archive (.tar). Theoretically, this should improve the compression, but
by how much?
How the script works
The script does not contain much intelligence. It iterates over a wide set of
compression commands that I tested out, checks the final compressed file size,
and if it is better than a previous one it keeps this compressed file (and
its statistics).
I tried to group some of the compressions together based on the algorithm used,
but as I don’t really know the details of the algorithms (it’s based on manual
pages and internet sites) and some of them combine multiple algorithms, it is
more of a high-level selection than anything else.
The script can also only run the compressions of a single application (which I
use when I’m fine-tuning the parameter runs).
A run shows something like the following:
Original file (test.nef) size 20958430 bytes
      package name                                                 command      duration                   size compr.Δ effic.:

The best compression was found with 7za -t7z -m0=PPMd:mem=28.
The compression delta obtained was 0.11643 within 10.58 seconds.
This file is now available as test.nef.7z.</p>

<p>In the above example, the test file was around 20 MByte. The best compression
compression command that the script found was:
~$ 7za -t7z -m0=PPMd:mem=28 a test.nef.7z test.nef</p>

<p>The resulting file (test.nef.7z) is 18 MByte, a reduction of 11,64%. The
compression command took almost 11 seconds to do its thing, which gave an
efficiency rating of 0,011, which is definitely not a fast one.
Some other algorithms don’t do bad either with a better efficiency. For
instance:
   app-arch/pbzip2                                                  pbzip2           0.6               19287402 0.07973 0.13071</p>

<p>In this case, the pbzip2 command got almost 8% reduction in less than a
second, which is considerably more efficient than the 11-seconds long 7za
run.
Want to try it out yourself?
I’ve pushed the script to my github
location. Do a quick review of the code first (to see that I did not include
anything malicious) and then execute it to see how it works:
~$ sw_comprbest -h
Usage: sw_comprbest –infile=&lt;inputfile&gt; [–family=&lt;family&gt;[,…]] [–command=&lt;cmd&gt;]
       sw_comprbest -i &lt;inputfile&gt; [-f &lt;family&gt;[,…]] [-c &lt;cmd&gt;]</p>

<p>Supported families: blosc bwt deflate lzma ppmd zpaq. These can be provided comma-separated.
Command is an additional filter - only the tests that use this base command are run.</p>

<p>The output shows</p>
<ul>
  <li>The package (in Gentoo) that the command belongs to</li>
  <li>The command run</li>
  <li>The duration (in seconds)</li>
  <li>The size (in bytes) of the resulting file</li>
  <li>The compression delta (percentage) showing how much is reduced (higher is better)</li>
  <li>The efficiency ratio showing how much reduction (percentage) per second (higher is better)</li>
</ul>

<p>When the command supports multithreading, we use the number of available cores on the system (as told by /proc/cpuinfo).</p>

<p>For instance, to try it out against a PDF file:
~$ sw_comprbest -i MEA6-Sven_Vermeulen-Research_Summary.pdf
Original file (MEA6-Sven_Vermeulen-Research_Summary.pdf) size 117763 bytes
…
The best compression was found with zopfli –deflate.
The compression delta obtained was 0.00982 within 0.19 seconds.
This file is now available as MEA6-Sven_Vermeulen-Research_Summary.pdf.deflate.</p>

<p>So in this case, the resulting file is hardly better compressed - the PDF
itself is already compressed. Let’s try it against the uncompressed PDF:
~$ pdftk MEA6-Sven_Vermeulen-Research_Summary.pdf output test.pdf uncompress
~$ sw_comprbest -i test.pdf
Original file (test.pdf) size 144670 bytes
…
The best compression was found with lrzip -z.
The compression delta obtained was 0.27739 within 0.18 seconds.
This file is now available as test.pdf.lrz.</p>

<p>This is somewhat better:
~$ ls -l MEA6-Sven_Vermeulen-Research_Summary.pdf* test.pdf*
-rw-r–r–. 1 swift swift 117763 Aug  7 14:32 MEA6-Sven_Vermeulen-Research_Summary.pdf
-rw-r–r–. 1 swift swift 116606 Aug  7 14:32 MEA6-Sven_Vermeulen-Research_Summary.pdf.deflate
-rw-r–r–. 1 swift swift 144670 Aug  7 14:34 test.pdf
-rw-r–r–. 1 swift swift 104540 Aug  7 14:35 test.pdf.lrz</p>

<p>The resulting file is 11,22% reduced from the original one.</p>

<p> 
What could the first intellgent species of an alien planet look like? Imagine a skeleton-less creature with three hearts, with most of its nearly half a billion neurons distributed in eight tentacular arms. Each arm can regenerate like the mythical Hydra and has a mind of its own. Its muscles stiffen into temporary elbows and shoulders. This creature has the eerie capability of perfect camouflage and decorates its lair with leftovers of its prey.
Such is the bizarre reality of an octopus. Octopuses represent the pinnacle of an evolutionary track alternate from man. They are cephalopods, a group of organisms including squid and cuttlefish that descended from a slow-moving, snail-like ancestor and became active, resourceful predators. Even though modern day snails, oysters and other mollusks have all evolved equally from this common ancestor in terms of time, octopuses somehow gained seemingly extraterrestrial capabilities. The secret lies in their genome.
“They were the first intelligent beings on the planet,” quipped Nobel Laureate Dr. Sydney Brenner, founding President and Distinguished Professor of Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST). Brenner was fascinated with the great sophistication of their nervous system and initiated the octopus Genome Project as the first of several important genome projects that have become a hallmark of OIST. The complexity of the octopus genome presented a major challenge.
 </p>

<p> 
A team of researchers from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), the University of Chicago, and the University of California, Berkeley have sequenced and analyzed the genome of an octopus species, making it the first cephalopod to be decoded. They published their findings in Nature. The genome-wide analysis was led at OIST by researchers in the Molecular Genetics Unit.
While the octopus genome resembles those of other marine invertebrates in many respects, it also revealed unexpected features that are key to understanding the origin and function of its unique nervous system. Cephalopod brains are elaborations of the basic invertebrate brain, and have a completely different organization than what is found in humans and other vertebrates. Cephalopods emerged as predators in the ancient oceans over three hundred million years ago.
The octopus genome encodes several large gene families that may hold the key to how the animal wires up its complex brain - these gene families are involved in regulation brain development in other animals, but they are vastly expanded in octopus. Their detailed role, however, remains unknown. Hundreds of other genes that are common in cephalopods but unknown in other animals were also found. Some of these are implicated in the dynamic skin of cephalopods that enables spectacular camouflage. Some of the team’s findings raise questions about our understanding of genomic reorganization through evolution.
The large genome size of the octopus was previously believed to be the result of whole genome duplication events, which can also be seen in the genomes of vertebrates, including humans. Such events create additional genetic material for evolution to work with. The octopus genome, however, shows no evidence of such a dramatic event in its evolutionary history.
Besides recognizable genes, vast swathes of the genome consist of regulatory networks that control how genes are expressed in cells. In the octopus, nearly half of the genome was found to be composed of mobile elements called transposons, one of the highest proportions in the animal kingdom. Transposons replicate and move around with a life of their own, disrupting or enhancing gene expression and facilitating reshufflings of gene order. The researchers found many of them to be particularly active in the octopus nervous system.
Genes that are grouped together on chromosomes in other animals were dispersed in the octopus genome, likely as a result of transposon activity. The “Hox” genes, involved in embryonic development in all animals, are a particularly dramatic example. Although clustered together in most animals, including other mollusks, they are scattered in snippets in the octopus, presumably enabling the evolution of the versatile cephalopod body plan.
Analysis of the sequenced octopus genome is far from exhausted. The sequenced genome also provides a reference for scientists studying cephalopods to investigate other species of these exotic animals. Future inquiry also relates to cephalopod genes and regulation relevant to the development and functioning of the nervous system. As some of those genes are already active at the embryo stage, their expression can be biochemically interfered with. Researchers can then watch out for divergences in the grown organism.
“To do all this, we need to be able to raise animals in the lab and have a better idea of what their normal behavior is, so we can recognize what has changed when a gene is deleted or disrupted. This is a big project, the kind that can only be done in a multidisciplinary environment like OIST,” said Daniel Rokhsar, head of OIST’s Molecular Genetics Unit.
Humans invented flying machines by mimicking birds. We can look forward to octopuses inspiring robots that give us easy access to the ocean floor.
As humans, we like to think we are unique in evolutionary terms, but the octopus could reveal that this is not the case. One reason the octopus fascinates scientists is that its brain became organized to be able to carry out such incredible, complex tasks without adopting the principles of the vertebrate brain. Further examination will tell if the building blocks of its nervous system are as radically different from those of vertebrate landlubbers like us, as the octopus’s abilities suggest.
This is not as unlikely as it sounds. Even if the octopus evolved in a completely different ecosystem, evolution can have only so many solutions to a given problem. If similarities are in fact found, this would significantly alter our perspective on the emergence of life elsewhere in the universe.
“The octopus appears so utterly different from all other animals, even ones it’s related to, that the British zoologist Martin Wells famously called it aAnimalia-lifen alien. In that sense, you could say our paper describes the first sequenced genome from an alien,” said Clifton Ragsdale, Associate Professor of Neurobiology and leader of the team that worked on the octopus at the University of Chicago.

  <p>Good things come to those who wait: The main Gentoo package repository (also known as the Portage tree or by its historic name gentoo-x86) is now based on Git.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Timeline</p>

<p>The Gentoo Git migration has arrived and is expected to be completed soon.
As previously announced,
the CVS freeze occurred on 8 August and Git commits for developers were opened soon after.
As a last step, rsync mirrors are expected to have the updated changelogs again on or after 12 August.
Read-only access to gentoo-x86 (and write to the other CVS repositories) was restored on 9 August following the freeze.</p>

<p>History</p>

<p>Work on migrating the repository from CVS to Git began in 2006 with a proof-of-concept migration project during the Summer of Code.
Back then, migrating the repository took a week and using Git was considerably slower than using CVS.
While plans to move were shelved for a while, things improved over the coming years.
Several features were implemented in Git, Portage, and other tools to meet the requirements of a migrated repository.</p>

<p>What changes?</p>

<p>The repository can be checked out from git.gentoo.org and is available via our Git web interface.</p>

<p>For users of our package repository, nothing changes:
Updates continue to be available via the established mechanisms (rsync, webrsync, snapshots).
Options to fetch the package tree via Git are to be announced later.</p>

<p>The migration facilitates the process of new contributors getting involved as proxy maintainers and eventually Developers.
Alternate places for users to submit pull requests, such as GitHub, can be expected in the future.</p>

<p>In regards to package signing, the migration will streamline how GPG keys are used.
This will allow end-to-end signature tracking from the developer to the final repository, as outlined in GLEP 57 et seq.</p>

<p>While the last issues are being worked on, join us in thanking everyone involved in the project.
As always, you can discuss this on our Forums or hit up @Gentoo.</p>

  <p>West Africa may be one of the most difficult and dangerous regions of the world in which to work, posing challenges that can prove deadly for project developers and their stakeholders. An ambitious bioenergy project in Sierra Leone highlights the sometimes-blurry line that separates development that is sustainable from that which is exploitative, as well as the numerous challenges faced when undertaking projects in poorly developed communities and countries.
As a Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) research team reports, a series of events — unexpected and anticipated — have taken their toll in terms of costs, revenues and the project development schedule of Addax Bioenergy Sierra Leone’s (ABSL) Makeni project.
As the SEI research team recounts in “Agricultural investment and rural transformation: a case study of the Makeni bioenergy project in Sierra Leone,” the Ebola outbreak in May 2014 took a terrible toll on the nation and the Makeni project, increasing costs, delaying development and driving it to the edge of viability.</p>

  <p>By Matthew Van Dusen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Feature by feature, they revealed themselves: the plains of Sputnik, the Norgay Montes and the vast and forbidding Cthulu Regio.</p>

<p>When the New Horizons spacecraft finally buzzed Pluto at roughly 30,000 mph on July 14, it sent back snaps of an untamed land of craterless plains and jagged ice mountains beyond our imagining. And those pictures of the dwarf planet traveled the expanse of space thanks to a 125-pound power plant that doesn’t know the meaning of quit.</p>

<p>It’s called the RTG, or Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator.</p>

<p>Originally designed by GE’s Space Division (now part of Lockheed Martin) in King of Prussia, Penn., this model of RTG has powered U.S. spacecraft since the Ulysses probe was launched in 1990. The electricity from the RTG doesn’t propel the spacecraft, which use inertia from the launch and gravity slingshots around planets, but it’s necessary for the missions to snap pics, gather data and phone home.Above: An artist’s rendition of the New Horizon spacecraft approaching Pluto’s moon Charon. Pluto is in the Background. Image credit: Getty Images Top: Pluto photographed by New Horizons on July 13, 2015. Image credit: NASA</p>

<p>The RTG takes advantage of the predictable decay of Plutonium 238, a radioisotope produced by certain nuclear power plants. The heat given off by the plutonium, which is in the form of 18 fire-resistant ceramic pellets, is transformed into electricity by a process known as the Seebeck effect.</p>

<p>Discovered by the 19th century German physicist Thomas Johann Seebeck, the effect describes how heat can be turned into electricity when two different conductive materials in a closed circuit called a thermocouple are kept at different temperatures. In a spacecraft, this means that the “hot” junction absorbs the heat from the plutonium while the “cold” junction is kept frigid by the near-absolute zero of space. The temperature difference between the two junctions results in an electrical current.</p>

<p>The internal heat source is necessary in space, where the sun’s energy is too weak to power solar panels. The RTG provided about 250 watts of power when New Horizons launched in 2006. But the device loses 5 percent of its power every four years and outputs about 200 watts currently.</p>

<p>GE was a critical part of the space race from its earliest days, working on computers, lunar landing modules, moonboots and even astronaut escape pods. But the RTGs were the most lasting contribution.</p>

<p>The older model RTGs GE engineered for the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft are still providing power for the craft, which have made it further from home than any manmade object in history.</p>

<p>The production of the thermocouples was stopped after the Voyager program in the 1970s sand GE had to kickstart it for the Galileo missions. The new model RTG, called a GPHS, or general-purpose heat source, used a different method to pack the plutonium fuel than the Voyager craft.</p>

<p>GE got out of the space business altogether in 1992. The company would still probably honor any service obligations, but the product is now a bit out of reach.</p>

  <p>The world’s largest offshore wind energy converter has been dubbed the DolWin beta by its producers ABB – which has offices in Ireland – and is being towed out to its new home in the North Sea.
The company says the gargantuan converter station has a 916MW power transmission capacity, making it the world’s most powerful installation of its kind, producing enough energy to power more than 1m households with clean energy.
Measuring 100m tall and long by 70m in width, the station is part of the DolWin2 project and will connect offshore wind farms in the North Sea’s DolWin cluster, currently the largest offshore wind farm cluster worldwide, with the German power grid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its main purpose will be to convert the electricity generated by the offshore wind farms from alternating current (AC) into high-voltage direct current (HVDC) for efficient and reliable transmission to the mainland.
Shipped from Dubai but built in the Norwegian town’s shipyard, the DolWin beta weighs around 23,000 tonnes and will secure itself to the ocean floor using an innovative self-installing gravity-based structure (GBS) concept.
“Putting such a huge platform in place is one of the most delicate operations in the delivery of an offshore power link, requiring intensive pre-planning and cooperation between the stakeholders involved and we are pleased that this important project landmark has gone smoothly,” said Claudio Facchin, President, ABB Power Systems division.
DolWin2 is part of Germany’s ambitious clean energy plan designated ‘Energiewende’, which aims to generate more than 6.5GW from offshore wind by 2020 and 15GW by 2030.

  <p>What do computers and brains have in common? Computers are made to solve the same problems that brains solve. Computers, however, rely on a drastically different hardware, which makes them good at different kinds of problem solving. For example, computers do much better than brains at chess, while brains do much better than computers at object recognition. A study published in PLOS ONE found that even bumblebee brains are amazingly good at selecting visual images with color, symmetry and spatial frequency properties suggestive of flowers. Despite their differences, computer science and neuroscience often inform each other.</p>

  <p>By Ki Mae Heussner</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Over a decade ago, the Human Genome Project gave us the first blueprint of our genetic code, opening the door to a future where medical interventions could be personalized for each patient’s genetic composition. Today, programs like the Human Protein Atlas are zooming in even deeper, mapping out not just the DNA that defines our bodies, but also the building blocks – specifically, the proteins – that make them tick (or sick).</p>

<p>We’ve known for a while that human DNA holds about 20,000 human genes that code for proteins. But it was only late last year that scientists led by Mathias Uhlén of the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, published the first comprehensive open-source map of 17,000 human proteins, showing where they are, and how they function in the human body.</p>

<p>Uhlén and his team are now drilling deeper into the data and seeking to analyze the remaining proteins. Their work, aided by super-fast protein purification technology developed by GE Healthcare Life Sciences, could have broad implications, from improving the understanding of human tissue at the molecular level to developing new diagnostic methods and treatments for cancer and other difficult-to-treat diseases.“The protein is the work horse of the cell and the body,” Uhlén says. “We’ve provided for the first time to the scientific community a comprehensive list of all the proteins which are in the kidney, the brain and [other organs] so you get a descriptive view of the molecular constituents of each cell in the human body.”Above: Human DNA is made from just four nucleic acids: Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine and Thymine. Top: Proteins like hemoglobin have extremely complex molecules.</p>

<p>In addition to creating a “periodic table” of the cellular building blocks, their work uncovered several findings related to the distribution of human proteins.</p>

<p>For example, the project has shown that almost half of all proteins are found in all tissues, while very few are unique to any one kind of tissue. That means, Uhlén says, that 30 percent of all drugs used today target proteins that are found in almost every cell in the human body.</p>

<p>“That’s, of course, very interesting and important for the pharmaceutical companies when they’re developing new drugs for new targets,” he says. “[They] can now go to the Protein Atlas and look at where these target proteins are in the human body.”</p>

<p>Beyond that, the Atlas could help advance personalized medicine by providing more information about biomarkers for different diseases. It could give medical researchers a better understanding of cancer since it includes samples from the 20 most common forms of the disease.</p>

<p>Uhlén his team started by identifying all of the 20,000 human genes that code for a protein and then cloning the genes in E.coli bacteria to produce the different proteins.An illustration of E.coli bacteria. </p>

<p>The next step involved using GE Healthcare’s ÄKTAexpress protein purification system, which allowed them to purify the individual proteins.</p>

<p>Once purified, Uhlén and team vaccinated animals with the proteins, causing them to make protein-specific antibodies that show up in different tissues and give away a protein’s location in the body. “Our system is a perfect fit for this type of study,” said Jill Simon, Global Product Manager for ÄKTAexpress at GE Healthcare.Producing and purifying each protein can be a very time-intensive manual process. By using 14 GE Healthcare instruments, Simon and her team estimate GE helped save the Human Protein Atlas more than 23,000 hours – or 2.7 years – of manpower.Antibodies (blue and yellow) attacking a cancer cell (red).</p>

<p>“This project would have been impossible if we didn’t have the fantastic instruments from GE Healthcare,” Uhlén says. “In order to do this, you need to automate different steps or it gets too expensive. Together with GE Healthcare, we developed an automated way of doing purification of the antibodies which is really working very well.”</p>

<p>Still, antibodies can be tricky to work with, Uhlén says. Sometimes, they help achieve good results, but other times they lead to false positives. Says Uhlén: “We want to clean that up in the next five or six years and, by 2020, have a complete map of where the proteins are in the human body.”</p>
