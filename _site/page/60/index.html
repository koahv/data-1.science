<blockquote>
  <p>UK and US regulators are urging their respective governments to act now in order to protect consumers from the potential dangers of the Internet of Things
For those unfamiliar with the term, the Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the ability of everyday objects to connect to the internet, allowing them to send and receive data. Nowadays, we all possess an abundance of personal gadgets that are constantly connected to the net, with practically everyone carrying a smartphone around in their pocket.
But the rise in other forms of technology that are constantly connected to the web is growing. This might be home automation systems that turn on your kettle when you wake up in the morning, to activity trackers that share with your friends how many miles you’ve run that day.
Six years ago the number of “things” connected to the internet surpassed the number of people
Six years ago the number of “things” connected to the internet surpassed the number of people, with experts estimating that in 2015, there will be more than 25 billion connected devices, and by 2020, that number will increase to 50 billion. 
It is for this reason that UK regulators, Ofcom and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the US are taking steps to create a regulatory framework that will protect consumers, though they are aware that any decision must be designed in such a way that it does not harm innovation in the technology sector.
In the UK, Ofcom wants to ensure that the necessary tools and infrastructure are in place to allow the IoT to develop unhindered. To support this, Ofcom has already released spectrum for machine-to-machine uses – making the UK among the first countries in Europe to do so.
Ofcom plans to work closely with the UK government, along with other regulators and the technology industry in order to strike a balance that will ensure that IoT products can be developed without barriers, but at the same time ensure that issues, such as data protection are protected.
“The Internet of Things will bring benefits to a range of sectors and could change the way we live our lives,” said Steve Unger, Acting Ofcom Chief Executive. “As a result of this growth, we have listened closely to industry and want to develop a framework for this technology to evolve in a way which will ultimately benefit citizens and consumers.”
In the US, the FTC admitted in a recent report that while the IoT will bring many benefits to consumers, it is likely to meld the virtual and physical worlds together in ways that are currently difficult to comprehend.
The US regulator shared similar sentiments to that of Ofcom, with it reluctant at this stage to propose any legislation for risk of harming its highly profitable technology sector, but recognised the need to protect consumers. For now, the FTC recommended self-regulatory efforts on the IoT, along with enactment of data security and broad-based privacy legislation.
“We’re now in a world where data is being collected all the time,” said FTC Commissioner Edith Ramirez at the State of the Net conference. “We’re bringing these devices into our homes, into what used to be private spheres, and the data that is being generated is increasingly much more sensitive.
“It’s really in my mind fundamental that consumers continue to be in the driver’s seat, that they have a say in their own information and how it’s being used.”</p>

"I think of Ceres actually as a game changer in the Solar System," said Britney Schmidt in 2013, science team liaison for the Dawn Mission. "Ceres is arguably the only one of its kind. "Ceres is like the gatekeeper to the history of water in the middle solar system."
"Ceres is a 'planet' that you've probably never heard of,” said Robert Mase, Dawn project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. Ceres, the largest body between Mars and Jupiter in the main asteroid belt, has a diameter of about 590 miles (950 kilometers). Some scientists believe the dwarf planet harbored a subsurface ocean in the past and liquid water may still be lurking under its icy mantle.
Ceres is a unique body in the Solar System, bearing many similarities to Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus, both considered to be potential sources for harboring life. In March of 2015, NASA's Dawn mission will arrive at the dwarf planet Ceres, the first of the smaller class of planets to be discovered and the closest to Earth.
When Ceres was discovered in 1801, astronomers first classified it as a planet. The massive body traveled between Mars and Jupiter, where scientists had mathematically predicted a planet should lie. Further observations revealed that a number of small bodies littered the region, and Ceres was downgraded to just another asteroid within the asteroid belt. It wasn't until Pluto was classified as a dwarf planet in 2006 that Ceres was upgraded to the same level.
Ceres is the most massive body in the asteroid belt, and larger than some of the icy moons scientists consider ideal for hosting life. It is twice the size of Enceladus, Saturn's geyser-spouting moon that may hide liquid water beneath its surface.
Unlike other asteroids, the Texas-sized Ceres has a perfectly rounded shape that hints toward its origins. As NASA's Dawn mission draws closer to its encounter with the dwarf planet Ceres in early 2015, excitement continues to mount for scientists looking forward to what the satellite might observe. In August and October of 2013, NASA team members hosted a Google+ Hangout to discuss the upcoming visit to the nearest dwarf planet in the solar system. Parts 1 and 11 of this fascinating discussion follow.
"The fact that Ceres is so round tells us that it almost certainly had to form in the early solar system," Schmidt said. She explained that a later formation would have created a less rounded shape. The shape of the dwarf planet, combined with its size and total mass, reveal a body of incredibly low density.
"Underneath this dusty, dirty, clay-type surface, we think that Ceres might be icy," Schmidt said. "It could potentially have had an ocean at one point in its history."
"The difference between Ceres and other icy bodies [in the Solar System] is that it's the closest to the Sun," Castillo-Rogez said.
Less than three times as far as Earth from the Sun, Ceres is close enough to feel the warmth of the star, allowing ice to melt and reform. Investigating the interior of the dwarf planet could provide insight into the early solar system, especially locations where water and other volatiles might have existed.
As large as Ceres is, its distance has made it a challenge to study from Earth. Images taken by the space-based Hubble Space Telescope provided some insight to its surface, but to be sighted, features could be no larger than 25 kilometers in diameter. Several round circular spots mar the terrain, features which Schmidt said could be any one of a number of geologic terrains, including potentially impact basins or chaos terrains similar to those found on Europa. The largest of these, named Piazzi in honor of the dwarf planet's discoverer, has a diameter of about 250 kilometers. If this feature is an impact basin, it would have been formed by an object approximately 25 km in size.
But for Schmidt, this is another possible indication about the dwarf planet's surface: "It doesn't mean that Ceres hasn't been hit by something bigger than 25 kilometers," she said."It just means that whatever is going on on Ceres has totally erased [the topographic signature of that event]."
Ceres may have suffered major impacts, especially during periods of heavy bombardment early in the Solar System's history. If the surface contained ice, however, those features may have been erased.
"The spectrum is telling you that water has been involved in the creation of materials on the surface," Schmidt said.
The spectrum indicates that water is bound up in the material on the surface of Ceres, forming a clay. Schmidt compared it to the recent talk of minerals found by NASA's Curiosity on the surface of Mars. "[Water is] literally bathing the surface of Ceres," she said.
In addition, astronomers have found evidence of carbonates, minerals that form in a process involving water and heat. Carbonates are often produced by living processes.
The original material formed with Ceres has mixed with impacting material over the last 4.5 billion years, creating what Schmidt calls "this mixture of water-rich materials that we find on habitable planets like the Earth and potentially habitable planets like Mars."
Water is considered a necessary ingredient for the evolution of life as we know it. Planets that may have once contained water, such as Mars, as well as moons that could contain it today, like Enceladus and Europa, are all thought to be ideal for hosting or having once hosted life.
Because of its size and closeness, Schmidt calls Ceres "arguably more interesting than some of these icy satellites. If it's icy, it had to have an ocean at some point in time," she said.
Castillo-Rogez compared Earth, Europa, and Ceres, and found that the dwarf planet bore many similarities to Earth, perhaps more than Jupiter's icy moon. Both Earth and Ceres use the Sun as a key heat source, while Europa takes its heat from its tidal interaction with Jupiter. In addition, the surface temperature of the dwarf planet averages 130 to 200 degrees Kelvin, compared to Earth's 300 K, while Europa is a frosty 50 to 110 K.
"At least at the equator where the surface is warmer, Ceres could have preserved a liquid of sorts," Castillo-Rogez said.
Liquid water could exist at other points on the dwarf planet known as cold traps, shadowed areas where frozen water could remain on the surface. Such icy puddles have been found on Earth's moon.
"The chemistry, thermal activity, the heat source, and the prospect for convection within the ice shell are the key ones that make us think that Ceres could have been habitable at least at some point in its history," Castillo-Rogez said.
As scientists develop more information about Europa and Enceladus, there has been a greater call to investigate the two prime sites for life. But Schmidt and Castillo-Rogez think that Ceres could also be a great boon for astrobiology and space exploration.
"It's not a difficult environment to investigate," she said."As we think about the future of landed missions for people and rovers, why not go to Ceres?"
Though it would be more challenging to drill into than Europa, which boasts an icy surface layer, the dwarf planet would make a great site to rove around on. Schmidt also noted that it could make a great launching point when it comes to reaching the outer solar system. Its smaller mass would make it easier to land on--and leave--than Mars, which could make it a good site for manned missions.
"We have such a big planet bias, we have such a bias for things that look exactly like us," Schmidt said. "In this kind of special place in the Solar System, we have a very unique object that might be telling us a lot about what we don't know about building a habitable planet."
"I think when we get to Ceres, it's just going to be an absolute game changer, a new window into the Solar System that we wouldn't have without going there," Schmidt said
As NASA's Dawn mission draws closer to its encounter with the dwarf planet Ceres in early 2015, excitement continues to mount for scientists looking forward to what the satellite might observe. Britney Schmidt, of the George Institute of Technology, and Nicole Gugliucci of CosmoQuest, recently hosted a Google+ Hangout titled 'Ceres: Great Expectations' to discuss the upcoming visit to the nearest dwarf planet in the solar system.
Orbiting in the asteroid belt, a little more than three times as far from the Sun as Earth, Ceres is thought to contain an icy mantle that makes up approximately a third of its mass. "Ceres is very different and very exciting in a lot of ways, totally different from any place that we've been," Schmidt said in the broadcast. "It may be the only primarily icy planet that's out there, at least within reach."
Seen through a telescope, Ceres may not appear very exciting. Scientists can use the light reflected off of a body to find out information about its composition. "Ceres, to the eye, would appear basically pretty black because it's reflecting most colors more or less the same, and reflecting very little light at all," said Andy Rivkin of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab.
Even the infrared spectrum, which tends to reveal more information about asteroids such as Vesta — Dawn's first stop — provided very little information about its composition. By utilizing instruments such as the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, scientists were able to catch hints about the dwarf planet's surface.
These observations revealed suggestions of brucite, hydroxyls, and two other features Rivkin says are thought to be due to carbonate minerals. "[This] makes Ceres one of only a few places where we've found carbonates," Rivkin said. "I think other than Earth and Mars, it's Ceres."
He went on to explain that scientists think water interacting with the minerals formed the brucite and the carbonates.

A thin outer crust covers the surface, with carbonates and other signs that water lay on the planet's skin at some point. Credit: NASA, ESA, and A. Feild (STScI).
 

 
"For Ceres, we think it is much more consistent with a body that had a lot of water available to interact with." But water, considered a potential habitat for life to start, can't exist on the surface of the dwarf planet in either solid or liquid form. "We see no real evidence for ice at the surface of Ceres," Rivkin said, noting that the dwarf planet is too warm. "However, conditions beneath Ceres’ surface should allow buried ice to remain there."
At the same time, observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, as well as theoretical data such as the planet's density, suggest that a large amount of ice exists. "That creates this interesting paradox. We think there's a lot of ice there, (but) we don't see any at the surface," Rivkin said. "How that's going to translate into what we find when we show up there is still very much an open question."
 

 
NASA’s Dawn spacecraft has just returned the sharpest images ever seen of the dwarf planet Ceres shown above. The images were taken 147,000 miles (237,000 kilometers) from Ceres on Jan. 25, and represent a new milestone for a spacecraft that soon will become the first human-made probe to visit a dwarf planet.
"We know so little about our vast solar system, but thanks to economical missions like Dawn, those mysteries are being solved," said Jim Green, Planetary Science Division Director at NASA Headquarters in Washington.
At 43 pixels wide, the new images are more than 30 percent higher in resolution than those taken by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope in 2003 and 2004 at a distance of over 150 million miles. The resolution is higher because Dawn is traveling through the solar system to Ceres, while Hubble remains fixed in Earth orbit. The new Dawn images come on the heels of initial navigation images taken Jan. 13 that reveal a white spot on the dwarf planet and the suggestion of craters. Hubble images also had glimpsed a white spot on the dwarf planet, but its nature is still unknown.
Zoomed out -- PIA19173 Ceres appears sharper than ever at 43 pixels across, a higher resolution than images of Ceres taken by the NASA's Hubble Space Telescope in 2003 and 2004.
As the spacecraft gets closer to Ceres, its camera will return even better images. On March 6, Dawn will enter into orbit around Ceres to capture detailed images and measure variations in light reflected from Ceres, which should reveal the planet’s surface composition.
"We are already seeing areas and details on Ceres popping out that had not been seen before. For instance, there are several dark features in the southern hemisphere that might be craters within a region that is darker overall," said Carol Raymond, deputy principal investigator of the Dawn mission at JPL. "Data from this mission will revolutionize our understanding of this unique body. Ceres is showing us tantalizing features that are whetting our appetite for the detailed exploration to come."
Originally described as a planet, Ceres was later categorized as an asteroid, and then reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. The mysterious world was discovered in 1801 by astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi, who named the object for the Roman goddess of agriculture, grain crops, fertility and motherly relationships.
“You may not realize that the word ‘cereal’ comes from the name Ceres. Perhaps you already connected with the dwarf planet at breakfast today," said JPL's Marc Rayman, Mission Director and Chief Engineer of the Dawn mission.
Powered by a uniquely capable ion propulsion system, Dawn also orbited and explored Vesta, the second most massive body in the asteroid belt. From 2011 to 2012, Dawn returned more than 30,000 images, 18 million light measurements and other scientific data about the impressive large asteroid. Vesta has a diameter of about 326 miles (525 kilometers).
"With the help of Dawn and other missions, we are continually adding to our understanding of how the solar system began and how the planets were formed,” said Chris Russell, principal investigator for the Dawn mission, based at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Recent developments in science are beginning to suggest that the universe naturally produces complexity. The emergence of life in general and perhaps even rational life, with its associated technological culture, may be extremely common, argues Clemson researcher Kelly Smith in a recently published paper in the journal Space Policy. What's more, he suggests, this universal tendency has distinctly religious overtones and may even establish a truly universal basis for morality.
Smith, a Philosopher and Evolutionary Biologist, applies recent theoretical developments in Biology and Complex Systems Theory to attempt new answers to the kind of enduring questions about human purpose and obligation that have long been considered the sole province of the humanities.
He points out that scientists are increasingly beginning to discuss how the basic structure of the universe seems to favor the creation of complexity. The large scale history of the universe strongly suggests a trend of increasing complexity: disordered energy states produce atoms and molecules, which combine to form suns and associated planets, on which life evolves. Life then seems to exhibit its own pattern of increasing complexity, with simple organisms getting more complex over evolutionary time until they eventually develop rationality and complex culture.
And recent theoretical developments in Biology and complex systems theory suggest this trend may be real, arising from the basic structure of the universe in a predictable fashion.
"If this is right," says Smith, "you can look at the universe as a kind of 'complexity machine', which raises all sorts of questions about what this means in a broader sense. For example, does believing the universe is structured to produce complexity in general, and rational creatures in particular, constitute a religious belief? It need not imply that the universe was created by a God, but on the other hand, it does suggest that the kind of rationality we hold dear is not an accident."
And Smith feels another similarity to religion are the potential moral implications of this idea. If evolution tends to favor the development of sociality, reason, and culture as a kind of "package deal", then it's a good bet that any smart extraterrestrials we encounter will have similar evolved attitudes about their basic moral commitments.
In particular, they will likely agree with us that there is something morally special about rational, social creatures. And such universal agreement, argues Smith, could be the foundation for a truly universal system of ethics.

  <p>Astronomers have shown what happens when a magnetosphere forms round a comet. The RPC-ICA instrument onboard the Rosetta spacecraft has been watching the early stages of how a magnetosphere forms around Comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko as it moves closer to the Sun along its orbit and begins to interact with the solar wind. As the comet gets warmer, volatile substances, mainly water, evaporate from the surface and form an atmosphere around the comet. The Sun’s ultraviolet radiation and collisions with the solar wind ionizes some of the comet’s atmosphere. The newly formed ions are affected by the solar wind electric and magnetic fields and can be accelerated to high speeds. When the comet gets close enough to the Sun, its atmosphere becomes so dense and ionized that it becomes electrically conductive. When this happens, the atmosphere starts to resist the solar wind and a comet’s magnetosphere is born - a region surrounding the comet that is shielded from the solar wind.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>When Justin Dowd worked as a food runner at a restaurant, he would sometimes doodle on the chalkboard in the kitchen. He had no idea that this skill — coupled with his ability to explain physics — would one day win him a trip to space.
The science writer and animator who created the TED-Ed lesson “Could comets be the source of life on Earth?” Dowd is known for illuminating concepts in physics — from Einstein’s discovery to black holes — using his own special brand of “chalkimation.” In 2012, his animated videos won him the Race for Space, a competition run by Metro to send a civilian astronaut on a short suborbital flight. Dowd will have a seat on-board the suborbital spaceplane XCOR Lynx and will chronicle his training and the flight for the newspaper.
We caught up with Dowd to talk about science, his upcoming trip to the cosmos and the wonders of creating this TED-Ed lesson out of nothing but chalk.
So, first of all, how did you pick the topic of comets for your TED-Ed lesson?
The lesson is about the discovery of amino acids and DNA-based pairs in the tails of comets, and the discovery that one out of five stars in our galaxy has a planet orbiting in it with a similar size and temperature to Earth. Those are two discoveries that have been made recently —  the amino acids discovery was made in 2004, and the Kepler study, which was the study that revealed about 40 million planets that are similar to Earth in our galaxy, came out about six months ago. These are both really, really recent discoveries that are indicating that the building blocks for proteins and DNA are common throughout our galaxy.
The last three years in physics have been the most exciting few years in, I’m guessing, about 20. There’s just been an extremely high density of amazing discoveries that people have been waiting for for decades. So it’s cool to pick these topics that have information in them that nobody has ever known before. That we know for the first time ever.
A still from this lesson, drawn completely in chalk by Justin Dowd.
The lesson looks beautiful. Why were you drawn to chalk as a medium?
I’ve been doing chalk videos for about four years now. The first time I ever drew on a chalkboard was in the kitchen of a restaurant where I was a food runner. The restaurant had a unique chalkboard where it wasn’t slate — it was wallboard with chalkboard paint over it — and it had this texture which allows you to work the chalk with your fingers and get really bright colors out of it.
For some reason, chalk and I get along. It’s kind of like a finger painting that’s dry because every color and every chalk stroke is gone over with your hands. You can dip your fingers in the powder and use your hands as a brush. And you can also erase it with your hands and move an image around. So when you’re doing animation, instead of doing multiple pictures that are separate, you can draw one mural and just manipulate the mural so that the images on it are slowly moving. You take pictures as you go, and once you have around 1,000 pictures, you have a minute or two of animation. It’s kind of gritty, and I get a lot of depth in the images.

Are there any challenges to keep in mind when working with chalk?
I tried to take this lesson up a notch from what I’ve done in the past. I wanted to go all-out. So I tried a lot of new, experimental techniques, and developing those was the hardest part. Pretty much everything that I’ve done in animation, the first idea looks good on paper, but then when you try and do it, it doesn’t work out. Some of the best things that I’ve learned how to do with chalk have been accidents.
For example, the stars that I use in the space images are chalk ground up into powder. You just pick up a little bit of chalk, snap your fingers, and tiny specks of it fall down on a chalkboard that’s laid horizontally, and it looks just like stars. The first time that I noticed that was when I was drawing on the chalkboard. I looked down at all these little specks, and it looked just like stars — and that’s something that I’d been trying to figure out. I’ve been using that technique ever since.

Speaking of space … you’re going to visit it soon. How did you hear about this contest?
I heard about it while I was doing a Sudoku on the T in Boston. They had an article about it in the Metro newspaper. I decided to enter, and to do something different, I decided to make animated videos using chalkboards explaining the basics of relativity. I didn’t expect to win. It was really a shot in the dark, but I’m extremely lucky to have been able to get a trip to space in the end.
The trip will be in about a year from now. They’re finishing the rocket in the Mojave Desert.  I can’t wait. I would fly tomorrow morning, if I could.
How long will you be in space?
It’s a short trip. It’s kind of like being shot out of a cannon, straight up. It takes four minutes to get about 65-70 miles up. It goes three times the speed of sound, and we float for about 15 minutes, and then re-enter the atmosphere, and the rocket becomes a glider and glides back and lands on a runway like a plane. It’ll take about an hour and a half. Most of it is gliding back down.
That’s going to be amazing. Any last thoughts you want to leave us with about your TED-Ed lesson?
My favorite fact in the lesson is the discovery that there are 40 million planets similar to Earth that likely have DNA base-pairs, and the building blocks of proteins are planted in all of them by comets. I’ll see shows on science channels where it’s like, “Comets: Apocalypse Doomsday” — all different things that make the solar system and galaxy seem hostile. But the more that we study the universe and the galaxy, the more these things like comets — which appear to be hostile — are actually factories for creating the raw materials of life. The laws of the universe give us little pockets of safety, and outside of these pockets, in space, are actually the perfect conditions to create the building blocks of life.
A still from the final animation of this lesson. Could comets be more than meets the eye?

Geologists from the University of Cambridge uncover hidden magnetic messages from the early solar system in meteorites measured at BESSY II. A team of scientists led by Richard Harrison from the University of Cambridge, has captured information stored inside tiny magnetic regions in meteorite samples that captures the dying moments of the magnetic field during core solidification on a meteorite parent body, providing a sneak preview of the fate of Earth’s own magnetic field as its core continues to freeze.
Meteorites were previously thought to have poor magnetic memories, with the magnetic signals they carry having been written and rewritten many times during their long journey to Earth. Harrison, however, identified specific regions filled with nanoparticles that were magnetically extremely stable. These “tiny space magnets” retain a faithful record of the magnetic fields generated by the meteorite’s parent body. Harrison and his colleagues could map these tiny magnetic signals using circular polarized X-ray synchrotron radiation at BESSY II. Their results have now been published in Nature.
Meteorites have witnessed a long and violent history; they are fragments of asteroids which formed in the early solar system, 4.5 billion years ago. Shortly after their formation, some asteroids were heated up by radioactive decay, causing them to melt and segregate into a liquid metal core surrounded by a solid rocky mantle. Convection of the liquid metal created magnetic fields, just as the liquid outer core of the Earth generates a magnetic field today. From time to time asteroids crash together and tiny fragments fall to Earth as meteorites, giving scientists the opportunity to study the properties of the magnetic fields that were generated billions of years ago.
“They are like natural hard discs”, Harrison believes. The geologist from the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge, UK, is searching for methods to decipher the information stored deep inside the space rocks. Now his new approach has yielded its first results.
Until now it was not clear whether ancient magnetic signals could be retained by stony-iron meteorites at all. Large and highly mobile magnetic domains are found within the iron metal: these domains create huge magnetic signals but are easily overwritten by new events. The probability that these regions might contain useful information about early magnetic fields in the solar system is extremely low.
But Harrison took a much closer look. At the PEEM-Beamline of BESSY II, Harrison and PhD student James Bryson found dramatic variation in magnetic properties as they went through the meteorite. They saw not only regions containing large, mobile magnetic domains, but also identified an unusual region called the cloudy zone containing thousands of tiny particles of tetrataenite, a super hard magnetic material. “These tiny particles, just 50 to 100 nanometers in diameter, hold on to their magnetic signal and don’t change. So it is only these very small regions of chaotic looking magnetization that contain the information we want”, Bryson concludes.
The PEEM-Beamline offers X-rays with the specific energy and polarization needed to make sense of these magnetic signals. Since the absorption of the X-rays depends on the magnetization, the scientists could map the magnetic signals on the sample surface in ultrahigh resolution without changing them by the procedure. “The new technique we have developed is a way of analyzing these images to extract real information. So we can do for the first time paleomagnetic measurements of very small regions of these rocks, regions which are less than one micrometer in size. These are the highest resolution paleomagnetic measurements ever made”, Harrison points out.
By spatially resolving the variations in magnetic signal across the cloudy zone, the team were able to reconstruct the history of magnetic activity on the meteorite parent body, and were even able to capture the moment when the core finished solidifying and the magnetic field shut down. These new measurements answer many open questions regarding the longevity and stability of magnetic activity on small bodies. Their observations, supported by computer simulations, demonstrate that the magnetic field was created by compositional, rather than thermal, convection - a result that changes our perspective on the way magnetic fields were generated during the early solar system and even provides a sneak preview of the fate of Earth’s own magnetic field as its core continues to freeze.

  <p>Monitoring File access, Changes and Data Modifications
 
Linux has several solutions to monitor what happens with your data. From changing contents to who accessed particular information, and at what time.
For our auditing toolkit Lynis, we researched and tested several solutions over the last few years. In this article we have a look at these solutions to monitor file access, changes and modifications to the data and beyond.
What is Data?
Data is a collection of bits, ordered in such a way it gives meaning to humans. The related information stored in data blocks, can be as simple as text, or become a visible representation like an image. Data is usually the most important part on a system, which means it has to be properly safeguarded.
Data versus Meta-data
Besides the information stored for us, the system needs to store a little bit of information as well. For example a data block on disk, might need some supporting information to know where it is stored. This data is usually not useful for us, but certainly for the system to retrieve the information, especially when we ask for it. This “data about data” is called meta-data. So besides protecting data, we have to take the protection of meta-data in mind as well.
Monitoring File Access
The first level of monitoring is who is accessing specific files. This helps us understand what particular files are being accessed, by what process and by whom. To accomplish this task, we can use the Linux audit framework. The framework is written by Red Hat and uses “watches” on files and directories to determine what should be monitored. Additionally it can monitor processes, including the underlying system calls which are performed by them.
Adding watches
To protect our kernel configuration, we can determine who accesses the sysctl.conf file. This file stores kernel settings, so it interesting to start with this file. To have this file monitored, we need to add a watch on the file.
auditctl -w /etc/sysctl.conf -p a -k kernel
The parameter -w sets the watch, followed by the file name. The -p defines the related permission action (a = attribute change, r = read, w = write, x = execute). It looks similar to file permissions, but actually it is slightly different. With the -k we define a custom key, which simplifies searching at a later moment. It is also helpful to categorize events.
Reporting watches
Now we have defined our watch, we can search for it with the earlier defined key.
ausearch -k kernel
Running this command gives us the following output:
File access monitoring with Linux audit framework
When looking at this output, you might be overwhelmed by all the fields available. Additionally some fields actually have rather strange values, like an architecture of c000003e (which actually equals x86_64).
The most important fields are the purple box, showing what object was hit and the green box revealing the process (or binary), followed by the defined key. In this case both the cat command and vim editor have opened the file
In this screenshot we can also see a failed syscall in the yellow box, with the value 89. To determine what syscall this is, we first have to look it up:
ausyscall –dump
This will show all available syscalls for our particular system architecture. So in this case a call to “getrusage”, to retrieve process statistics from the kernel.
Monitoring specific functions
We can use the Linux audit framework also for monitoring specific system calls, or functions. We have to use the -S followed by the system call.
auditctl -a always,exit -S openat -F success=1
The -a always,exit defines to write out an event at exit time of the related system call.
For example when you want to monitor all successful “openat” calls, add this system call and tell auditctl only to log successful requests. In this case you might get a message that the system call is unclear, as it is found on multiple architectures. Find the related system call ID with ausyscall openat and add the ID instead. Even better is specifying the architecture together with the system call, as it is easier to read (example: -F arch=b64 -S openat).

File Integrity Monitoring
Another interesting level to monitor file changes, is by implementing file integrity tooling. Linux has several options for this, varying from simple tools up to kernel modules.
File Integrity Tools
The easiest way to verify if a file has been changed, is using tools. Simple tools like md5sum or shasum can help with detecting changes. Also specialized tools like AIDE and Samhain are a great help to set-up automatic monitoring and alerting.
Since setting up these tools are worth a blog post of their own, it will be covered in a separate post.
Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA)
The most extensive option is monitoring files with IMA. This security module allows the system to create and monitor hashes for files and block unauthorized changes.
IMA has a few modes it can operate in, like fix and appraise. In “fix mode” the system allows the administrator to set hash values along each file. These hashes are small strings of text to help the system detect changes and are stored in extended attributes (xattrs) of the file system.
Digital signatures
Additionally IMA supports digital signing. This ensures you that the contents of the file is correct (or unaltered). Additionally because it is signed, you can validate the signature. So if a file is to be changed, it also needs proper signing.
Since IMA is a very extensive way of monitoring, we will cover more in other blogs posts. It’s a very exciting subject and a great help to protect your data.
Extended Verification Method (EVM)
Where IMA monitors the file contents, EVM performs monitoring of the file attributes. It also allows hashing and digital signing. It’s a great extension to IMA, to ensure that both contents and the attributes of a file are being unaltered.
Monitoring File Attributes
To monitor file permissions, we can also use the audit framework. File permissions and ownership are part of the file attributes. The file attributes can be monitored with “-p a“.
Additionally, we can use the earlier covered EVM to ensure attributes are not changed by an unauthorized process or person.
Conclusion
Now we have looked at some of the tools, it should be clear that a lot of areas can be monitored on Linux systems. It is up to the administrator to define what files should be monitored and to which extent. From simply logging changes to attributes with the Linux audit framework, up to fully blocking altered files with IMA and EVM.

Scientists plumbing the depths of the ocean have made a surprise finding that could change the way we understand supernovae, exploding stars way beyond our solar system. They have analysed extraterrestrial dust thought to be from supernovae, that has settled on ocean floors to determine the amount of heavy elements created by the massive explosions.
“Small amounts of debris from these distant explosions fall on the earth as it travels through the galaxy,” said lead researcher Anton Wallner, from the Research School of Physics and Engineering at The Australian National University (ANU).
“We’ve analysed galactic dust from the last 25 million years that has settled on the ocean and found there is much less of the heavy elements such as plutonium and uranium than we expected.”
The findings are at odds with current theories of supernovae, in which some of the materials essential for human life, such as iron, potassium and iodine are created and distributed throughout space. Supernovae also create lead, silver and gold, and heavier radioactive elements such as uranium and plutonium.
Wallner’s team studied plutonium-244 which serves as a radioactive clock by the nature of its radioactive decay, with a half-life of 81 million years. “Any plutonium-244 that existed when the earth formed from intergalactic gas and dust over four billion years ago has long since decayed,” Wallner said. “So any plutonium-244 that we find on earth must have been created in explosive events that have occurred more recently, in the last few hundred million years.”
The team analysed a 10 centimetre-thick sample of the earth’s crust, representing 25 million years of accretion, as well as deep-sea sediments collected from a very stable area at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.
“We found 100 times less plutonium-244 than we expected,” Wallner said. “It seems that these heaviest elements may not be formed in standard supernovae after all. It may require rarer and more explosive events such as the merging of two neutron stars to make them.”
The fact that these heavy elements like plutonium were present, and uranium and thorium are still present on earth suggests that such an explosive event must have happened close to the earth around the time it formed, says Wallner.”Radioactive elements in our planet such as uranium and thorium provide much of the heat that drives continental movement, perhaps other planets don’t have the same heat engine inside them.”

One of Venus Express’ first discoveries, made during its very first orbit, was confirming the existence of a huge atmospheric vortex circulation at the south pole with a shape matching the one glimpsed at the north pole. This ghostly puff of smoke is a mass of swirling gas and clouds, as seen by the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) aboard ESA’s Venus Express spacecraft.
Venus has a very choppy and fast-moving atmosphere – although wind speeds are sluggish at the surface, they reach dizzying speeds of around 400 km/h at the altitude of the cloud tops, some 70 km above the surface. At this altitude, Venus’ atmosphere spins round some 60 times faster than the planet itself. This is very rapid; even Earth’s fastest winds move at most about 30% of our planet’s rotation speed. Quick-moving Venusian winds can complete a full lap of the planet in just four Earth days.
Polar vortices form because heated air from equatorial latitudes rises and spirals towards the poles, carried by the fast winds. As the air converges on the pole and then sinks, it creates a vortex much like that found above the plughole of a bath. In 1979, the Pioneer Venus orbiter spotted a huge hourglass-shaped depression in the clouds, some 2000 km across, at the centre of the north polar vortex. However, other than brief glimpses from the Pioneer Venus and Mariner 10 missions in the 1970s, Venus’ south pole had not been seen in detail until ESA’s Venus Express first entered orbit in April 2006.
This south polar vortex is a turbulent mix of warming and cooling gases, all surrounded by a ‘collar’ of cool air. Follow-up Venus Express observations in 2007, including this image, showed that the core of the vortex changes shape on a daily basis. Just four hours after this image the vortex looked very different and a day later it had morphed into a squashed shape unrecognisable from the eye-like structure here.
A video of the vortex, made from 10 images taken over a period of five hours, can be seen here. The vortex rotates with a period of around 44 hours.
The swirling region shown in this VIRTIS image is about 60 km above the planet’s surface. Venus’ south pole is located just up and to the left of the image centre, slightly above the wispy ‘eye’ itself.
This image was obtained on 7 April 2007 at a wavelength of 5.02 micrometres. It shows thermal-infrared emission from the cloud tops; brighter regions like the ‘eye’ of the vortex are at lower altitude and therefore hotter.

  <p>sarahnaomi writes For the first time ever, astronomers have captured an enormous radio wave burst in real time, bringing us one step closer to understanding their origins. These fleeting eruptions, called blitzars or FRBs (Fast Radio Bursts), are truly bizarre cosmic phenomena. In the span of a millisecond, they emit as much radiation as the Sun does over a million years. But unlike other super-luminous events that span multiple wavelengths—gamma ray bursts or supernovae, for example—blitzars emit all that energy in a tiny band of the radio light spectrum. Adding to the mystery is the rarity of blitzar sightings. Since these bursts were first discovered in 2007 with Australia’s Parkes Telescope, ten have been identified, the latest of which was the first to be imaged in real time.

It was sent into space courtesy of a Lockheed Martin Atlas V rocket, and the little craft will approach Pluto at the end of a 9 and a half year journey in July of 2015 (so it still has a little ways to go). It will pass by the dwarf planet and its moons (Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx) travelling at a staggering speed of 26,700 mph (43,000 km/h). It will then continue its path into the Kuiper belt, a disc-shaped region of volatile icy compounds such as methane, ammonia ,and water located past Neptune’s orbit (it is obviously also located past Pluto’s orbit, but Pluto is widely considered to be a Kuiper Belt object. Hence the phrasing with emphasis on Neptune).
And notably, New Horizons has just started its first stages of its encounter with Pluto. “NASA first mission to distant Pluto will also be humankind’s first close up view of this cold, unexplored world in our solar system,” said Jim Green, director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division at the agency’s Headquarters in Washington. “The New Horizons team worked very hard to prepare for this first phase, and they did it flawlessly.”
New Horizons is set to engage in a long-range photo shoot of Pluto later this month (January 25th). The images will be notable for several reasons. First, they will help us better understand the strange orbit of this dwarf planet and its many moons. Second, the images will help scientists navigate the spacecraft as it covers the remaining 135 million miles (220 million kilometers) to Pluto.
Unfortunately, the images will show little more than a small, white dot. That is, that’s all they will show until May, when it really starts to get its close encounter. However, the photos to come our over the next few weeks and months will assist us in making the necessary course corrections so that the rest of the mission is successful and goes as planned.
“We need to refine our knowledge of where Pluto will be when New Horizons flies past it,” said Mark Holdridge, New Horizons encounter mission manager at Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland. “The flyby timing also has to be exact, because the computer commands that will orient the spacecraft and point the science instruments are based on precisely knowing the time we pass Pluto – which these images will help us determine.”
“We’ve completed the longest journey any spacecraft has flown from Earth to reach its primary target, and we are ready to begin exploring,” said Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator.

Were the molecules in comet ices and terrestrial oceans born with the system itself—in the planet-forming disk of dust and gas that circled the young sun 4.6 billion years ago? Or did the water originate even earlier—in the cold, ancient molecular cloud that spawned the sun and that planet-forming disk?
Up to half of the water on Earth is likely older than the solar system itself, University of Michigan astronomers theorize. The researchers' work helps to settle a debate about just how far back in galactic history our planet and our solar system's water formed.
Between 30 and 50 percent came from the molecular cloud, says Ilse Cleeves, a doctoral student in astronomy at University of Michigan. That would make it roughly a million years older than the solar system.
To arrive at that estimate, Cleeves and Ted Bergin, a professor of astronomy, simulated the chemistry that went on as our solar system formed. They focused on the ratio of two slightly different varieties of water—the common kind and a heavier version. Today, comets and Earth's oceans hold particular ratios of heavy water—higher ratios than the sun contains.
"Chemistry tells us that Earth received a contribution of water from some source that was very cold—only tens of degrees above absolute zero, while the sun being substantially hotter has erased this deuterium, or heavy water, fingerprint," Bergin said.
To start their solar system simulation, the scientists wound back the clock and zeroed out the heavy water. They hit "go" and waited to see if eons of solar system formation could lead to the ratios they see today on Earth and in comets.
"We let the chemistry evolve for a million years—the typical lifetime of a planet-forming disk—and we found that chemical processes in the disk were inefficient at making heavy water throughout the solar system," Cleeves said. "What this implies is if the planetary disk didn't make the water, it inherited it. Consequently, some fraction of the water in our solar system predates the sun."
All life on Earth depends on water. Understanding when and where it came from can help scientists estimate how common water might be throughout the galaxy.
"The implications of these findings are pretty exciting," Cleeves said. "If water formation had been a local process that occurs in individual stellar systems, the amount of water and other important chemical ingredients necessary for the formation of life might vary from system to system. But because some of the chemically rich ices from the molecular cloud are directly inherited, young planetary systems have access to these important ingredients.
"Based on our simulations and our growing astronomical understanding, the formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen atoms is a ubiquitous component of the early stages of stellar birth," added Bergin. "It is this water, which we know from astronomical observations forms at only 10 degrees above absolute zero before the birth of the star, that is provided to nascent stellar systems everywhere."
