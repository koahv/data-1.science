  <p>Monitoring Linux Systems
Detecting and preventing rootkits
Rootkits are considered to be one of the most tricky pieces of malware. Usually they are loaded onto the system by exploiting weaknesses in software. Next phase is being installed and hide as good as possible, to prevent detection. We have a look at a few security measures you can take to prevent this kind of threat.
 
System Protection</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kernel
The kernel is the brain of the software system and decides what should be executed by the central processing unit. Any “damage” to this system decreases the integrity of the system and your data. So protecting the kernel against unauthorized modifications is an important step in keeping system secure.
 
Modules
Linux was originally a monolithic kernel, consisting of all functions in one piece of software. Nowadays its flexible, allowing additional functionality to be loaded when required. The downside of this is the chance that malicious people use this to load new kernel module, which in their turn alter how the kernel functions. For example when requesting a process listing, the kernel might leave out specific processes. Rootkits use these kind of tricks to prevent detection and it shows (pun intended).
 
Binaries
Next in line are software components and system utilities in particular. Tools like ps, ls, netstat and others are targeted by rootkits, to avoid detection.
 
Intrusion Detection
While prevention is a good thing, detection is usually even more valuable. After all, if you can’t detect an intrusion, how do you know for sure you are safe? Let’s have a look at a few possibilities to perform malware and intrusion detection.
 
File Integrity Monitoring
Objective: Monitor changes to files and binaries in particular
How
File integrity monitoring can be implemented on different levels. Even a small script collecting all hashes could be a start. Better would be the usage of file integrity tools, which can detect changes and perform intrusion detection. Common examples include AIDE, AFICK and Samhain.
If you want to go even a step further, you can use IMA and EVM, which are Linux security modules to do file integrity for all files. When the kernel sees a file which is changed, it refuses to execute the file. This is definitely the maximum level of protection.
 
Malware Detection Tools
Object: Use proper tooling to detect malware.
Tools like Rootkit Hunter help with detection some forms of rootkits. ClamAV and LMD are other great examples of tools who can search for traces of malware.
 
Intrusion Prevention
While full system hardening is preferred, we focus on some powerful methods to prevent the biggest threats to break in.
 
Upgrade the System
Objective: stay up-to-date with software components
How
Upgrade on a regular basis software components. Also implement a strategy on how to deal with security upgrades in particular. Most Linux distributions have a way to split these security patches, so you can easily focus on those first.
Reboot
Additionally it is wise to check for a required reboot. Patching is a great first step, but the kernel itself should be reloaded if there is a new version. Sure, we also know uptime is important and your customers don’t like reboots. But there is personal data at stake and usually more important than that tiny window of downtime.
 
Disable kernel modules
Objective: Disable loading of kernel modules, if system does not require it.
How
Check lsmod output, blacklist modules which are not being used by using the blacklist file. Additionally, disable loading all kernel modules for full protection.
 
Blacklist Kernel Modules
Create a custom file in /etc/modprobe.d directory, like custom-blacklisted.conf.
For example our output looks like this:</p>

<p>root@ubuntu:/etc/modprobe.d# lsmod
 Module                  Size  Used by
 ppdev                  17671  0
 serio_raw              13462  0
 i2c_piix4              22155  0
 joydev                 17381  0
 parport_pc             32701  0
 mac_hid                13205  0
 lp                     17759  0
 parport                42348  3 lp,ppdev,parport_pc
 xts                    12914  1
 gf128mul               14951  1 xts
 dm_crypt               23177  1
 hid_generic            12548  0
 usbhid                 52570  0
 hid                   106148  2 hid_generic,usbhid
 psmouse               106678  0
 ahci                   25819  2
 libahci                32560  1 ahci
 e1000                 145174  0</p>

<p>So let’s blacklist these items with:
blacklist e1000
blacklist psmouse
blacklist usbhid
blacklist hid_generic
blacklist lp
blacklist mac_hid
blacklist ppdev
blacklist serio_raw
blacklist i2c_piix4
blacklist joydev
blacklist parport_pc
Surprisingly we still see some show up after rebooting the system.</p>

<p>root@ubuntu:/etc/modprobe.d# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
lp                     17759  0
parport                42348  1 lp
xts                    12914  1
gf128mul               14951  1 xts
dm_crypt               23177  1
hid_generic            12548  0
usbhid                 52570  0
hid                   106148  2 hid_generic,usbhid
psmouse               106678  0
ahci                   25819  2
libahci                32560  1 ahci
e1000                 145174  0</p>

<p>Some modules are still being loaded, like lp, usbhid and e100. This is due the modules being loaded at boot time. Some are actually needed, although the output looks like the module is being unused. For example e1000 is our network driver.
The lp module on the other hand is not needed, as can be seen by the dmesg output for lp: [  219.078098] lp: driver loaded but no devices found.
So we should disable this driver from /etc/modules:
Kernel modules to be loaded at boot time
After adding a hash to the line starting with “lp”, we reboot the system another time. This time it is gone. Due to the blacklist line, services like udev can not load it anymore. However, modprobe still can. So we have to put in another layer of defense: disable loading new kernel modules.
 
Disabling Loading of Kernel Modules
To disable new modules from being loaded, a kernel setting have to be put in place via the sysctl command. By setting the value for kernel.modules_disabled to 1, no more kernel modules can be loaded.
Linux kernel modules being disabled with sysctl key
As can be seen in the screenshot above, the system refuses to turn on the setting again (even though it displays the value of 0). The great thing of this option is that attackers can’t disable this setting without rebooting the system. To keep things secure, you might want to monitor the system for unauthorized reboots as well.

  <p>The windy conditions that have battered Ireland have been be a major boon to the country’s wind-energy production, contributing to its largest ever wind-energy output.The figure recorded by EirGrid this morning (Wednesday) at 9.30am showed that 1,942MW of energy had been created through the country’s wind energy turbines which is enough to power over 1.26m homes.Despite us being only a matter of days within the new year, this marks the second time in 2015 that the record has been broken as on 1 January, wind energy output was as high as 1,872MW.According to the Irish Wind Energy Association (IWEA), when combined with the output from Northern Ireland, the island’s total output this morning was 2,490MW.Since the start of the new year, the equivalent of 33pc of Ireland’s energy has been produced through the high winds of recent days.Throughout the country, there are 188 wind farms currently operating which employ over 3,400 people.Speaking of the latest results, IWEA chief executive, Kenneth Matthews said, “Last year, here in Ireland we spent €6.7bn on expensive foreign energy imports, and going forward we need to make sure that as much of this lost money stays in Ireland, to stimulate our own domestic economy.”</p>

The largest NASA Hubble Space Telescope image ever assembled, this sweeping bird’s-eye view of a portion of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) is the sharpest large composite image ever taken of our galactic next-door neighbor. Though the galaxy is over 2 million light-years away, The Hubble Space Telescope is powerful enough to resolve individual stars in a 61,000-light-year-long stretch of the galaxy’s pancake-shaped disk. It’s like photographing a beach and resolving individual grains of sand. And there are lots of stars in this sweeping view – over 100 million, with some of them in thousands of star clusters seen embedded in the disk.
This ambitious photographic cartography of the Andromeda galaxy represents a new benchmark for precision studies of large spiral galaxies that dominate the universe’s population of over 100 billion galaxies. Never before have astronomers been able to see individual stars inside an external spiral galaxy over such a large contiguous area. Most of the stars in the universe live inside such majestic star cities, and this is the first data that reveal populations of stars in context to their home galaxy.
Hubble traces densely packed stars extending from the innermost hub of the galaxy seen at the left. Moving out from this central galactic bulge, the panorama sweeps from the galaxy’s central bulge across lanes of stars and dust to the sparser outer disk. Large groups of young blue stars indicate the locations of star clusters and star-forming regions. The stars bunch up in the blue ring-like feature toward the right side of the image. The dark silhouettes trace out complex dust structures. Underlying the entire galaxy is a smooth distribution of cooler red stars that trace Andromeda’s evolution over billions of years.
Because the galaxy is only 2.5 million light-years from Earth, it is a much bigger target in the sky than the myriad galaxies Hubble routinely photographs that are billions of light-years away. This means that the Hubble survey is assembled together into a mosaic image using 7,398 exposures taken over 411 individual pointings.
The panorama is the product of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) program. Images were obtained from viewing the galaxy in near-ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared wavelengths, using the Advanced Camera for Surveys and the Wide Field Camera 3 aboard Hubble. This cropped view shows a 48,000-light-year-long stretch of the galaxy in its natural visible-light color, as photographed with Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys in red and blue filters.

  <p>When GE opened its first research center in 1900, it employed three people and fit inside a barn behind the chief engineer’s house in Schenectady, N.Y.
It burned down a year later.
The lab then relocated to “safer premises” and become a dynamo, powering GE’s innovation, gathering thousands of patents and even employing several Nobel laureates. Today, the upstate New York lab is part of a global GE research network of some 3,000 scientists stretching from New York to Brazil, China, Germany, India, and China. Take a look at some of their projects that could one day shape the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Radislav Potyrailo, a principal scientist at GE Global Research, and his team are using the science of the very small, nanotechnology, and the science of light, photonics, to mimic the properties of the jagged, tree-like scales on the wings of butterflies from the Morpho genus (see top image). They want to use their findings to develop fast, ultra-sensitive thermal and chemical imaging sensors that could have applications in night vision goggles, super-sensitive surveillance cameras, and handheld and wearable medical diagnostic devices.
 </p>

<p>Potyrailo’s colleague Grigorii Soloveichik is working on electric flow batteries that could hold tens of kilowatt-hours of power. Besides cars, flow batteries could be used as backup power for wind farms and other renewable sources of energy, power entire neighborhoods, and also support the grid. “They can store energy from wind, for example, so power companies can use it when they need it,” Soloveichik says.
 </p>

<p>Engineer James Yang and his team are working on a technology called Direct Write, also known as 3D Inking. Big Data is the lifeblood of the Industrial Internet, and Direct Write allows machine designers to use special “inks” to print miniature data gathering sensors directly inside jet engines, gas turbines and other hot, harsh and hard to reach places. “We can use it to print sensors on 3D surfaces,” says Yang. “One day they could be anywhere.”
 </p>

<p>Not far from Schenectady, GE opened a new manufacturing and development facility exploring solid oxide fuel cell technology. Its fuel cells works like a battery, using a simple chemical reaction to unlock energy from hydrogen molecules abundant in natural gas and oxygen in ordinary air. The new system’s power generation efficiency can reach 65 percent, a holy grail of this technology. Its overall efficiency can grow even further: to 95 percent when the system is configured to capture waste heat produced by the process. “The cost challenges associated with the technology have stumped a lot of people for a long time,” says Johanna Wellington, advanced technology leader at GE Global Research and the head of GE’s fuel cell business. “But we made it work, and we made it work economically. It’s a game-changer.”
 </p>

<p>Sweat carries a trove of valuable information about how our bodies are feeling. Scientists at several labs are now trying to decode it with nanotechnology and develop flexible, Band-Aid-like wireless sensors sensitive enough to detect a single drop of biomolecules found in sweat in 2.5 million gallons of water (that’s enough to fill 50,000 bathtubs). The Air Force is interested in using the sensors to monitor pilots, and understand and improve their performance. But the technology could have much broader civilian applications. “Physical and mental fatigue is a factor for air traffic controllers, fire fighters, heavy-equipment operators, and many other professions,” says Scott Miller, lab manager for nanostructures and surfaces at GE Global Research.</p>

<p>Miller’s colleague Matt Webster is working on a universal calorie counter that could detect the amount of energy stored in any food. The GE team together with researchers at Baylor University’s Department Electrical and Computer Engineering is now testing the system on simple mixtures of oil, water and sugar. They have built a prototype, but the big prize is a push-button device that could be in every kitchen. One day the team could link the device with a smartphone app or a workout wristband.</p>

<p>GE is also working on machines that could study the brain in a greater detail. One group of researchers is looking at imaging the mobility of water molecules in the brain to better understand how the organ is wired, as well as the health and function of these connections, sort of a wiring diagram of the brain. In the future, medical scanners could be used to study diseases ranging from stroke to Alzheimer’s and clinical depression.</p>

<p>LED lights developed by engineers at GE Lighting could one day revolutionize agriculture and move farming indoors. One such farm is also working in Japan.</p>

<p>Scientists working in GE labs have developed tiny electrical switches thinner than a human hair that can transmit kilowatts of power. They are called micro-electro-mechanical systems, or MEMS. MEMS could help reduce waste heat and power consumption in medical devices, aviation systems and other industrial products. But the researchers are also working on miniaturized applications for smartphones and tablets using the next-generation LTE-Advanced, or “True 4G,” wireless standard. The new standard could allow users to receive data as fast as 3 gigabits per second, 10 times faster than existing 4G networks.</p>

<p>GE Ventures recently invested in Airware, a technology company developing a suite of hardware, software, and cloud services for commercial drone applications. Drones equipped with the technology already took part in an anti-poaching exercise in a northern white rhino wildlife preserve in Kenya. “We want to make it easy for customers to build drones for any commercial application and operate them in a safe and reliable manner,” says Jonathan Downey, founder and CEO of Airware. “This is something the industry as well as regulators have been asking for.”</p>

<p>GE researchers have used a special magnetic material to achieve temperatures cold enough to freeze water (and chill beer). The breakthrough system, which is projected to be 20 percent more efficient than current refrigeration technology, could be inside your fridge by the end of the decade. 
The system is using a water-based fluid flowing through a series of magnets to transfer heat, rather than a chemical refrigerant and a compressor. This significantly lowers any harm to the environment and makes the recycling of old refrigerators simpler. “This is a big deal,” says Venkat Venkatakrishnan, a leader of the research team. “We are on the cusp of the next refrigeration revolution.”</p>

class="wp-caption-text"&gt;An artist’s conception of a quasar.<br />NASA / Dana BerryMost large galaxies contain a central <a title="Black Hole eBook from Sky &amp; Telescope" href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/free-ebook-black-holes/?utm_source=MY&amp;utm_medium=ar&amp;utm_campaign=MYstar122214" target="_blank">supermassive black hole. Some — such as the one in the Milky Way’s center — are dormant beasts. Others, known as quasars, outshine their host galaxies as they chow down on gas.Black holes must transition from active to dormant status, but big changes should occur on astronomical timescales that dwarf human lifetimes. So when Stephanie LaMassa (Yale University) found two radically different spectra of an object measured just 10 years apart, she was shocked.Most of quasars’ visible-light emission comes from the hot accretion disk that feeds the black hole. Orbiting gas clouds, heated and ionized by the disk, make their contribution to the visible spectrum in the form of emission lines. These wavelength-specific spikes of emission may vary in brightness, but they don’t generally change shape. Some lines are fat, spreading their emission over a wide range of wavelengths, while others are skinny. Typically, fat lines stay fat and skinny lines stay skinny.The first spectrum, measured in 2000 with the <a href="http://www.sdss.org/" target="_blank">Sloan Digital Sky Survey, resembled a classic quasar: blue in color with broad emission lines. But the second spectrum, measured in 2010 as part of the <a href="https://www.sdss3.org/surveys/boss.php" target="_blank">BOSS Survey, didn’t exhibit those same emission lines. The broad component of one emission line, known as H-beta, had disappeared entirely, and another, known as H-alpha, had become only weakly visible.&lt;div
id="attachment_255430880" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;<a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/LaMassas_Figures_600.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-255430880" src="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/wp-content/uploads/LaMassas_Figures_600.jpg" alt="The top figure is the quasar's spectrum taken in 2000, while the bottom figure is the quasar's spectrum taken in 2010.

class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The quasar’s spectrum in 2000 (top) as compared to the quasar’s spectrum in 2010 (bottom).<br />BOSS / Stephanie LaMassaSpectral lines aside, the object had dimmed to one-tenth its former brightness; once identified as a quasar, the object now looked almost like a galaxy.So the million-dollar question became: what caused such a drastic and immediate change?Diet or Dust Cloud?At face value, the simplest possibility is that a cloud of dust has obscured our line of sight, dimming the quasar’s disk and the clouds of gas that orbit it. But to do this multiple lines of sight must be blocked: our line of sight toward the quasar and the gas clouds’ line of sight toward the accretion disk.The setup is analogous to the solar system, Gordon Richards (Drexel University) says: even after the Sun has set from Earth’s perspective, it will still light up the Moon and other planets because they have a different line of sight to the Sun. So in this analogy, something would have to obscure both the Earth’s line of sight and the other objects’ line of sight to the Sun.LaMassa and her colleagues modeled how a cloud might obscure a quasar’s spectrum, and they found that no single dust cloud could reproduce the observations. To avoid overly complex scenarios, the research team favors the interpretation that the quasar shut off completely.But they’re still baffled by how this drastic change could occur in 10 years or less. Astronomically speaking, that’s a blink of an eye. Most accretion disks extend far beyond the orbit of Uranus and emit 10 to 1,000 times more light than their host galaxy. Turning one off seems physically impossible in this short time-frame.“I’m not sure at what level we would expect the activity to die out at — whether it would be with a bang or with a whimper,” says LaMassa.This wacky object seems to have raised more questions than it can answer. But AGN expert Paul Martini (The Ohio State University) says it’s a fortunate turn of events. “It’s a great opportunity to study how accretion onto a supermassive black hole shuts down. It’s also a great way to see what the host galaxy looks like right after the end of the quasar phase.”And if the quasar turns back on, potential abounds. Astronomers think that every galaxy goes through an active stage. “The question is: is it a continuous process?” says Richards. “Is it like a dimmer switch that goes up and down with time but never really shuts off? Or is it like an on-off switch?”LaMassa observed the object at Palomar only a week after its initial discovery, and her observations in 2014 closely matched the object’s spectrum seen in 2010. Only time (and more observations) will tell if the object will continue to fade into quiescence or return to its initial state. In the meantime, this object has plenty of stories to share.Reference:Stephanie M.

A team of scientists has mapped the location of hydrogen-rich waters found trapped kilometres beneath Earth’s surface in rock fractures in Precambrian rocks make up over 70% of the surface of the Earth’s crust in Canada, South Africa and Scandinavia.
The team says their findings provide a “global network of sites” with hydrogen-rich waters that can be targeted in the search for deep life over coming years. They also point to the implications for life on Mars. The Red Planet has ancient rocks with hydrogen-producing potential, so could also host microbial life: “If the ancient rocks of Earth are producing this much hydrogen, it may be that similar processes are taking place on Mars,” Sherwood Lollar, a geoscientist at University of Toronto’s Department of Earth Sciences, said.
Scientists said the water is found in the oldest rocks on Earth – Precambrian Shield rocks. Findings showed they have a chemistry similar to water found near deep sea vents, meaning they could support microbes living in isolation. The study, to be published in Nature on December 18, includes data from 19 different mine sites that were explored by Lollar, senior research associate Georges Lacrampe-Couloume, and colleagues at Oxford and Princeton universities.
“This represents a quantum change in our understanding of the total volume of Earth’s crust that may be habitable,” lead author Lollar said. “Until now, none of the estimates of global hydrogen production sustaining deep microbial populations had included a contribution from the ancient continents.” She said the terrain represents a “sleeping giant”, with the huge area a “source of possible energy for life”.
The authors explain that understanding how much hydrogen is produced is key to understanding the amount of Earth’s habitable subsurface. Deep in gold mines and under the sea, hydrothermal vents release geothermally heated waters that are hydrogen rich. They host complex microbial communities nurtured by the chemicals dissolved in the fluid.
