Find out the first six essential Raspberry Pi upgrades in part one of our feature.
Pi-sized portable display with touchscreen
What is it?
The PiTFT is a 2.8-inch capacitive TFT LCD touchscreen that’s been specifically designed with the Raspberry Pi in mind by the project gurus over at Adafruit. It’s capable of slotting directly on top of the Raspberry Pi and is about as big as the Pi is itself.
The PiTFT touchscreen adds a ton of functinality to any Raspberry Pi
Why do it?
There are numerous reasons why you’d want to add such a screen to a Raspberry Pi but they all generally come down to the fact that the Pi is very small and very portable and most monitors are not. While you could VPN in via a phone if you’re on the go, the screen is connected directly to the Pi and doesn’t involve awkward wireless networking. Also as a touchscreen you don’t need to bring along other input devices, as it’s powered off the Raspberry Pi as well.
This opens it up to a world of possibilities. Portable computer, touchscreen control pad, video camera… anything that could benefit from your Raspberry Pi having a screen and human input while away from your main monitor.
How to use it?
All you need to get it to work is the PiTFT from our friends at Pimoroni. Soldering required. Turn the Raspberry Pi off and slot it into the GPIO. Make sure it’s still connected to a conventional screen and turn it back on again, staying in command line mode. Right now the PiTFT will not turn on as you need to configure the Raspberry Pi, and more specifically Raspbian, to support it.
Once you’re logged in you can start the process by downloading files with:
$ wget http://adafruit-download.s3.amazonaws. com/libraspberrypi-bin-adafruit.deb
$ wget http://adafruit-download.s3.amazonaws. com/libraspberrypi-dev-adafruit.deb
$ wget http://adafruit-download.s3.amazonaws. com/libraspberrypi-doc-adafruit.deb
$ wget http://adafruit-download.s3. amazonaws.com/libraspberrypi0-adafruit.deb
$ wget http://adafruit-download.s3.amazonaws. com/raspberrypi-bootloader-adafruit-112613.deb
Install them all with sudo dpkg -i -B *.deb and then give it a reboot. Once you’ve logged back in you can install the driver for the actual screen with:
$ sudo modprobe spi-bcm2708
$ sudo modprobe fbtft_device name=adafruitts rotate=90
$ export FRAMEBUFFER=/dev/fb1
$ startx
At this point you should be getting a picture on the screen, however once you reboot it won’t last. To exit it for now press CTRL+C. To make it work on boot we’ll first open /etc/modules and add:
spi-bcm2708
fbtft_device
Save that file and now open the Adafruit configuration file with:
$ sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/adafruit.conf
… and add the following line:
options fbtft_device name=adafruitts rotate=90 frequency=32000000
That’s the screen rotated 90 degrees there, and now we need to do the same with the touch aspect to orient it properly. We need to create a directory and file to handle this:
$ sudo mkdir /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
$ sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-calibration.conf
In this new file you’ll need to add:
Section “InputClass”
   Identifier “calibration”
   MatchProduct “stmpe-ts”
   Option “Calibration” “3800 200 200 3800”
   Option “SwapAxes” “1”
EndSection
It’s just about configured. Edit the ‘~/.profile’ file by adding export FRAMEBUFFER=/dev/fb1 and save. Now after a reboot every time you use startx you’ll turn on the display; to have it turn on whenever the Pi is on install:
$ sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg- video-fbdev
After this, create the file /usr/share/X11/xorg. conf.d/99-fbdev.conf and add to it:
Section “Device”
   Identifier “myfb”
   Driver “fbdev”
   Option “fbdev” “/dev/fb1”
EndSection
Go to Raspbian configuration with raspi-config, enable the desktop and finally press Finish in order to perform a reboot. You should log in with the screen turned on.
The screen is a little small like this and it’s better for custom-designed interfaces, using Python or whatever you prefer. The touchscreen can also be calibrated with some extra software if it’s not precise enough for you as well.
Predict the weather
What you’ll need
Adafruit BMP180
Breadboard
Wires
What is it?
A barometric pressure sensor allows you detect changes in the air pressure. Coupled with a temperature sensor it can predict short-term changes in the weather.
The pressure sensor can aid you in forecasting the weather
Why do it?
Being able to predict the weather has the obvious benefits of knowing whether or not to bring an umbrella or sunglasses into work. However, you could also use it in home automation to open windows or close curtains when it’s hot or about to start raining.
Get up and running
Step 01 Enable i2c
In the terminal, open the modules file to activate the I2C pins by adding two lines. After the following, reboot:
$ sudo nano /etc/modules</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i2c-bcm2708
i2c-dev</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>						GA_googleFillSlot("LUD_MidPage_MPU1");
					
				Step 02 Get the code The software for the BMP is available from the Adafruit GitHub (github. com/adafruit). Download it and navigate to the relevant folder: $ git clone https://github.com/adafruit/ Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code.git $ cd Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code $ cd Adafruit_BMP085 Step 03 Test your sensor Now you&amp;#8217;re almost ready to get some data by first installing a package and then testing. You can do this in the terminal with the following commands: $ sudo apt-get install python-smbus $ sudo python Adafruit_BMP085_example.py Wiring up your pressure sensor is very simple Control motors and steppers What is it? There’s a fundamental drive instilled in all tinkerers and it goes something very much like, ‘If you can, add motors to it’. The Raspberry Pi is no exception and in fact, adding motors to the Pi has become a cottage industry of its own, with everyone and their Kickstarter-funded dog looking for a piece of the action. There are countless ways you can power motors with the Raspberry Pi, starting from a simple IC chip – the good old L293D – that can be breadboarded with relative ease. The easier option, though, is to purchase an add-on board with a suitable motor driver IC already installed. We’ve chosen to demonstrate the PicoBorg Reverse – a board so versatile they can be daisy-chained together to run a robot powerful enough to tow a caravan&amp;#8230; While tiny, the PicoBorg is still very powerful Why use it? Why add motor control to your Raspberry Pi? There’s a great range of project ideas, from a motorised dolly to move your camera during time-lapse photography shoots, to autonomous and remote-controlled robots able to scoot around the house. We picked PiBorg’s PicoBorg Reverse for a couple of reasons. It caters for the widest range of motor sizes, it doesn’t hog the entire GPIO header (a real bug-bear with many other solutions) and it offers its own expansion header so you can daisy-chain boards together and still access the all-important power and ground pins for further use. It’s far from being the cheapest motor driver on the market, but it’s certainly one of the most project-friendly and user-friendly. How to use it In terms of setting up, the guys at PiBorg have been incredibly thoughtful. The PicoBorg Reverse comes with two colour-coded three- pin cables to connect the board to your Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins. It also comes with a mounting kit so you can easily connect the board to your Raspberry Pi without losing access to any of the connectors. With the board mounted and the two cables connected as per their instructions, the installation process turns to the software side of things. Check out the step-by-step software installation guide below for full details. The Python library supplied with the PicoBorg Reverse is very full-featured and even allows for hardware immobilisation should there be any difficulties. The library itself also includes a Help() text function that breaks down and lists every function and its parameters in plain English. PicoBorg Reverse software installation If you thought the hardware was easy, the software is essentially automatic&amp;#8230; Step 01 Download the examples Create a folder for the Python module and example scripts to go in. At the terminal type: mkdir ~/picoborgrev Navigate into the folder (cd ~/picoborgrev). Step 02 Run the script The PicoBorg Reverse uses I2C for communication, but instead of manually setting things up, all you need to do is unzip the download, change the permissions (with: chmod +x install.sh), then run the script simply by typing ‘./install.sh’ at the command prompt. It really is that straightforward. Step 03 Check out the example programs Assuming you’ve got your motors already connected, you’re ready to go. You’ll even find a new desktop shortcut on your Raspberry Pi with a small GUI program to help you get started. You can find all the example programs and Python library functions on the PiBorg website. Add amplified stereo speakers What is it? The Adafruit Stereo Amplifier MAX98306 is a small board that connects to a Raspberry Pi on one end and stereo speakers on the other. Turn your Raspberry Pi into a boom box with a little help from this amplifier Why do it? The Raspberry Pi has no on-board speakers and can only output via HDMI or the analogue audio jack. It&amp;#8217;s not amplified well, so the output is rather quiet. How to use it Strip the wire on your headphone-style cable. Unravel one side of the cable and attach each part to either the positive (+) and negative (-) of the R or L side. Then, attach the other cable to the remaining side&amp;#8217;s positive and negative . Wire up the speakers, attach VDD to power and GND to ground, choose a gain on the gain selector pins (start lower at first) and finally plug the jack into the Raspberry Pi. Follow @LinuxUserMag

Lawrence Livermore scientists for the first time have experimentally re-created the conditions that exist deep inside giant planets, such as Jupiter, Uranus and many of the planets recently discovered outside our solar system. The data described in this work are among the first tests for predictions made in the early days of quantum mechanics, more than 80 years ago, which are routinely used to describe matter at the center of planets and stars. While agreement between these new data and theory are good, there are important differences discovered, suggesting potential hidden treasures in the properties of diamond compressed to such extremes.
Researchers can now re-create and accurately measure material properties that control how these planets evolve over time, information essential for understanding how these massive objects form. This study focused on carbon, the fourth most abundant element in the cosmos (after hydrogen, helium and oxygen), which has an important role in many types of planets within and outside our solar system. The research appears in the July 17 edition of the journal, Nature.
Using the largest laser in the world, the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, teams from the Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley and Princeton University squeezed samples to 50 million times Earth’s atmospheric pressure, which is comparable to the pressures at the center of Jupiter and Saturn. Of the 192 lasers at NIF, the team used 176 with exquisitely shaped energy versus time to produce a pressure wave that compressed the material for a short period of time. The sample – diamond – is vaporized in less than 10 billionths of a second.
Though diamond is the least compressible material known, the researchers were able to compress it to an unprecedented density greater than lead at ambient conditions.
“The experimental techniques developed here provide a new capability to experimentally reproduce pressure-temperature conditions deep in planetary interiors,” said Ray Smith, LLNL physicist and lead author of the paper. Such pressures have been reached before, but only with shock waves that also create high temperatures – hundreds of thousands of degrees or more – that are not realistic for planetary interiors. The technical challenge was keeping temperatures low enough to be relevant to planets. The problem is similar to moving a plow slowly enough to push sand forward without building it up in height. This was accomplished by carefully tuning the rate at which the laser intensity changes with time.
“This new ability to explore matter at atomic scale pressures, where extrapolations of earlier shock and static data become unreliable, provides new constraints for dense matter theories and planet evolution models,” said Rip Collins, another Lawrence Livermore physicist on the team.
Future experiments on NIF are focused on further unlocking these mysteries. The image at the top is from the Chandra X-Ray Space Telescope, which observed Jupiter for its entire 10-hour rotation, the northern auroral X-rays were discovered to be due to a single ‘hot spot’ that pulsates with a period of 45 minutes, similar to high-latitude radio pulsations previously detected by NASA’s Galileo and Cassini spacecraft.

Levay (STScI)Astronomers can use the Hubble Space Telescope to <a title="Galaxies Trace Early Cosmic History" href="/astronomy-news/galaxies-trace-early-cosmic-history/">view galaxies near the edge of the observable universe (the region of space from which light has had a chance to reach us within the last 13.77 billion years). By examining a very tiny portion of the sky, counting up the number of galaxies visible in that region, and then multiplying that number to account for all the regions of the sky, astronomers estimate the number of galaxies in the observable universe. The best estimate from a 1999 study set that number at about 125 billion galaxies, but a 2013 study indicated that there are 225 billion galaxies in the observable universe.It’s important to understand that the number of galaxies in the universe hasn’t doubled in the past decade—these estimates represent the number of galaxies we can detect, given the power of our current telescopes, our observing time, and the wavelength of light we are observing. If we had larger telescopes and more observing time, we would be able to detect even fainter galaxies. Because of the finite age of the universe, even with the most powerful telescopes we could ever create, we would eventually run out of galaxies to count in the observable universe.Counting Galaxies By Their Dark Matter HalosThere is no hard-set limit on the smallest number of stars that can make up a galaxy (dwarf galaxies might host as few as a thousand stars, whereas star clusters orbiting galaxies can contain more than a million). The distinction lies in dark matter halos: galaxies and dwarf galaxies have them, while star clusters do not.So to estimate how many galaxies we could theoretically observe, we would want to know the number of dark matter halos in the observable universe, and the probability that any halo with a certain mass would form stars, explains Henry Ferguson (Space Telescope Science Institute). Currently, there is no consensus on these values, but estimating the galactic population with this method could result in a number much higher than 225 billion.<hr />The universe holds more galaxies than you could ever observe.

Using the current expansion rate of the universe, we can imagine “rewinding” the universe to the point where everything was contained in a singularity, and calculate how much time must have passed between that moment (the Big Bang) and the present.But extrapolating back to the Big Bang also requires knowing the history of the expansion rate, which we can learn about by examining the current density and composition of the universe. Cosmologists have studied observations of the cosmic microwave background, relic radiation leftover from the Big Bang, to determine these parameters.Two spacecraft have measured the cosmic microwave background across the full sky: the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and Planck. Planck improved upon WMAP's observations with greater sensitivity and resolution. As of 2013, <a title="Planck's Map of the Cosmic Microwave Background" href="/astronomy-news/planck-best-map-yet-of-cosmic-creation/">Planck data has set the age of the universe at about 13.77 billion years (plus or minus 59 million years).The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/how-old-is-the-universe/">How old is the universe? appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com">Sky &amp; Telescope.

The next phase of a global drive to map the night sky will bring the cosmos into greater focus than at any in human history. Already, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey has registered more than half a million stars in the Milky Way (a portion of which is shown in the image above) and more than two million galaxies and quasars. The new, fourth phase of the survey broadens the project’s scope and will dramatically expand its database. A major component will focus on mapping the distribution of galaxies and quasars from 3 to 8 billion years ago. During that period, dark energy began to have an impact on the universe.
“The power of a large survey is that there may be surprises we weren’t planning on, and that means learning something really new,” said C. Megan Urry, Yale’s Israel Munson Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics and director of the Yale Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics.
“One of the things my group is really excited about is the possibility of getting more information about black holes growing in distant galaxies, including the most luminous ones, known as quasars,” Urry said. “By surveying a very large fraction of the available sky, SDSS IV will greatly increase our knowledge about when and where the most massive black holes grow.”
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is an initiative that spans four continents and includes 200 astronomers at more than 40 institutions. They will chart thousands of nearby galaxies, probe the composition of stars throughout the Milky Way with novel clarity, and measure the expansion of the universe during a particularly murky period.
Survey officials announced the fourth phase of the effort on July 15. It will make use of not only the Sloan Foundation 2.5-meter Telescope in New Mexico, but also the 2.5-meter Irenee du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.
       
         
 
This phase has three new components. One will be to create much more detailed maps of nearby galaxies, thanks to an optical fiber bundle technology that takes spectra of each part of a galaxy simultaneously. Another effort will use the Chilean telescope to monitor the makeup and movement of stars throughout the Milky Way that cannot be observed from New Mexico.
“When people ask me what I do I say I’m helping to map the universe,” said John K. Parejko, a postdoctoral research associate at Yale and operations software developer for the sky survey. “It’s not just that we’ll have incredibly more data than ever before, but that the quality and uniformity of the data will be unrivaled for years to come.”
With such a map, scientists can retrace the history of the Universe over the last six billion years. With that history, they can get better estimates for how much of the Universe is made up of dark matter - matter that we can't directly see because it doesn't emit or absorb light - and dark energy, the even more mysterious force that drives the accelerating expansion of the Universe.
"Dark matter and dark energy are two of the greatest mysteries of our time," said David Schlegel of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, who led the earlier SDSS-III effort to map these galaxies and quasars. "We're confident this new map will guide us, or someone else, in solving these mysteries."
That map of the Universe is the centerpiece of DR9 shown in the image at the top of page. Data Release 9 (DR9) was the latest data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Data Release 9 was the first release of the spectra from the SDSS-III's Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), which includes more than 800,000 spectra over 3,300 square degrees of sky, observed with the new 1,000-fiber BOSS spectrograph.It included new spectra from 540,000 galaxies from when the Universe was half its present age. A spectrum is a measure of light from a galaxy at different wavelengths; from this information we can measure the distances to those galaxies. This distance information provides the third dimension in the DR9 map, providing a more detailed view of the structure of the Universe than has been measured before.
Quasars provide further details to the three dimensional map and another way to measure the distribution of matter in the Universe. Quasars are the brightest objects in the distant Universe, and their spectra reveal intricate patterns imprinted by the intergalactic gas and underlying dark matter that lies between each quasar and the Earth.
The data in DR9 are not only helping us understand the distant Universe, but also our own cosmic backyard, the Milky Way galaxy. DR9 includes better estimates for the chemical compositions of more than half a million stars in our own galaxy. "With these better estimates, we can look back at the history of our galaxy," said Connie Rockosi of the University of California Santa Cruz, who led the SDSS- III's Milky Way study.
