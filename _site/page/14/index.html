The recent 125th flyby of Saturn's giant moon Titan (T-125) was the prelude to Cassini's final acts, which will play out over the next year. That pass placed Cassini in a high-inclination orbit tilted 60° relative to the ring plane.

>When the first group of American astronauts started training for space flight in the 1950s, Air Force doctors put them through a number of wrenching trials. In one, they had to endure many multiples of the force of gravity we experience at sea level — or G-force. John Glenn experienced 7.9 Gs during his first orbital flight, and others briefly went as high as 32 Gs on Houston’s infamous G Machine. “You couldn&#8217;t lift your arm out of the couch above about 6 or 7 Gs,” Glenn told a historian. “Beyond that you were just supported there.” But all of those numbers pale in comparison with a new kind of G Machine ­— GE’s computed tomography scanner called Revolution CT. Rather than preparing humans for exploring the universe, doctors use it to...

>The shift to using more efficient lights inspired GE and Intel to create smart LEDs that can see, hear and sense their surroundings, creating data that can improve efficiency and empower smart city services. &nbsp; &nbsp; Since American inventor Thomas Edison patented the first commercially successful bulb in 1879, the population of light fixtures has exploded. Today, an estimated 2.5 billion light bulbs are sold each year. Despite being a modern life necessity and symbol of illuminating ideas, many think light bulbs do little more than turn on, off or dim.  Instead, innovation in lighting is quickening. LED — Light Emitting Diode — bulbs, for example use a solid state semiconductor chip that glows when electrical current runs through it. T...

According to Verlinde, gravity is not a fundamental force of nature, but an emergent phenomenon. In the same way that temperature arises from the movement of microscopic particles, gravity emerges...
