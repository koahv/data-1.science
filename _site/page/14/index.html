<blockquote>
  <p>The shift to using more efficient lights inspired GE and Intel to create smart LEDs that can see, hear and sense their surroundings, creating data that can improve efficiency and empower smart city services.
 
 
Since American inventor Thomas Edison patented the first commercially successful bulb in 1879, the population of light fixtures has exploded. Today, an estimated 2.5 billion light bulbs are sold each year.
Despite being a modern life necessity and symbol of illuminating ideas, many think light bulbs do little more than turn on, off or dim.  Instead, innovation in lighting is quickening. LED — Light Emitting Diode — bulbs, for example use a solid state semiconductor chip that glows when electrical current runs through it. They’re bright, use up to 80 percent less energy and can last fifteen times longer than incandescent bulbs, according to GE.
Now engineers are making smart LED lights with sensors, computing and communication capabilities. Light bulbs are destined to become an essential fixture in the Internet of Things revolution, according to Tony Neal-Graves, vice president of Intel’s industry Internet of Things Group.
“You already have a fixed location with power running through it where it’s easy to add sensors, and they’re already in every place you’d want to collect data,” he said in an interview with GE Reports.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In San Francisco last August, GE showed how intelligent street lamps can play a critical role in making cities, buildings and factories smarter and connected.
“We partnered with Intel and put sensors in them to measure humidity and temperature, microphone for sound, camera that can see things,” said John Gordon, chief digital officer at GE’s Current energy division, during a keynote at the Intel Developer Forum.
“We get metadata, like the count of people, their speed and direction. Cities could use this for pedestrian flow management and mitigating safety incidents,” according to Gordon.
He said the real-time data collected from smart lampposts could help people find parking, help with traffic control and keep close tabs on air quality.
Months before that demo, the two companies created a smart lighting prototype to solve a challenge in a GE turbine factory in Greenville, South Carolina. Sensors built into light fixtures are designed to send data to the internet, where cloud computing collects, analyzes and send instructions to control the lights.

These intelligent lights measure the temperature of the air around a turbine ring while it was being attached to rotors. Knowing precisely when the part was cool enough to initiate the next attachment sped the process and helped avoid defects, according to Marcus Kennedy, commercial director for industrial and energy solutions division, Intel’s Internet of Things Group.
He said GE determined that replacing existing lights with smart LED lights that measure temperature could save the company hundreds of thousands of dollars.
“We took the LED light and added an Intel chip on board that processes all of the information coming from the sensor,” said Kennedy. “Outside the light is a puck that looks like a miniature Apollo moon landing pod. It has many sensors, including a motion detector, an ambient temperature sensor, a pointed thermocouple sensor that uses infrared to measure temperature up to ten feet away.
He said it improved a critical step in turbine-making process, but having smart lights could help solve problems not yet realized.
“When they realize they have a new problem, GE isn’t going to want to refresh all their lights again,” said Kennedy. Built-in intelligence means the lights can adapt to measure or track new needs as they arise.</p>

<p>Kennedy said the world is rapidly moving away from fluorescent and incandescent to LED.
“We want to leverage this wave in order to make those LED implementations smarter,” he said. “When cities like San Diego and New York move to LED lights they can now consider using intelligent LEDs, which are capable of solving future challenges or efficiency needs.”
Kennedy said smart lights can go almost anywhere.
“They can go in office buildings and be used to monitor occupancy then control temperature and lights,” he said.
Data could be used to help people find the nearest open collaboration room.
“Just pull up your app or go online and see open rooms rather than walking around hoping to find an empty one.”
Intel’s Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters is equipped with thousands of controllable LED lights, including many with the ability to sense occupancy. This pilot could extend to other Intel facilities. By early 2017, Intel and GE expect to sell lighting-based sensors to other companies for use in factories and offices.
“To me, that’s what engineering and the whole internet of things is all about,” said Kennedy. “Unlocking new opportunities or doing things differently so people can come up with things we never thought of.”

Google DeepMind’s artificial intelligence team, along with researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, has trained AI machines to interact with objects in order to evaluate their properties without any prior awareness of physical laws. The team set about various trials in different virtual environments in which the AI was faced with a series of blocks and tasked with assessing their properties.
Advances in artificial intelligence have yielded intelligent machines that can achieve superhuman performance in Go, Atari, natural language processing, and complex control problems,but it is not clear that these systems can rival the scientific intuition of even a young child. The new reserach embraced the view in developmental science that human babies are endowed with a small number of separable systems of core knowledge for reasoning about objects, actions, number, space, and possibly social interactions.
When encountering novel object, humans and other animals are able to infer a wide range of physical properties such as mass, friction and deformability by interacting with themin a goal driven way. This process of active interaction is in the same spirit of a scientist performing an experiment to discover hidden facts.
The study, entitled Learning to perform physics experiments via deep reinforcement learning, explained that while recent advances in AI have achieved ‘superhuman performance’ in complex control problems and other processing tasks, the machines still lack a common sense understanding of our physical world – ‘it is not clear that these systems can rival the scientific intuition of even a young child.’ "We found," the team concluded, "that state of art deep reinforcement learning methods can learn to perform the experiments necessary to discover these hidden properties of the physical world. By systematically manipulating the problem difficulty and the cost incurred by the AI agent for performing experiments, we found that agents learn different strategies that balance the cost of gathering information against the cost of making mistakes in different situations."

A new theory of gravity might explain the curious motions of stars in galaxies. Emergent gravity, as the new theory is called, predicts the exact same deviation of motions that is usually explained by invoking dark matter.
Erik Verlinde, renowned expert in string theory at the University of Amsterdam and the Delta Institute for Theoretical Physics, published a new research paper today in which he expands his groundbreaking views on the nature of gravity.
In 2010, Erik Verlinde surprised the world with a completely new theory of gravity. According to Verlinde, gravity is not a fundamental force of nature, but an emergent phenomenon. In the same way that temperature arises from the movement of microscopic particles, gravity emerges from the changes of fundamental bits of information, stored in the very structure of spacetime.
 

In his 2010 article (On the origin of gravity and the laws of Newton), Verlinde showed how Newton's famous second law, which describes how apples fall from trees and satellites stay in orbit, can be derived from these underlying microscopic building blocks.
Extending his previous work and work done by others, Verlinde now shows how to understand the curious behavior of stars in galaxies without adding the puzzling dark matter.
The outer regions of galaxies, like our own Milky Way, rotate much faster around the center than can be accounted for by the quantity of ordinary matter like stars, planets and interstellar gasses.
Something else has to produce the required amount of gravitational force, so physicists proposed the existence of dark matter. Dark matter seems to dominate our universe, comprising more than 80 percent of all matter. Hitherto, the alleged dark matter particles have never been observed, despite many efforts to detect them.
According to Erik Verlinde, there is no need to add a mysterious dark matter particle to the theory.
In a new paper, which appeared today on the ArXiv preprint server, Verlinde shows how his theory of gravity accurately predicts the velocities by which the stars rotate around the center of the Milky Way, as well as the motion of stars inside other galaxies.
"We have evidence that this new view of gravity actually agrees with the observations, " says Verlinde. "At large scales, it seems, gravity just doesn't behave the way Einstein's theory predicts."
At first glance, Verlinde's theory presents features similar to modified theories of gravity like MOND (modified Newtonian Dynamics, Mordehai Milgrom). However, where MOND tunes the theory to match the observations, Verlinde's theory starts from first principles. "A totally different starting point," according to Verlinde.
One of the ingredients in Verlinde's theory is an adaptation of the holographic principle, introduced by his tutor Gerard 't Hooft (Nobel Prize 1999, Utrecht University) and Leonard Susskind (Stanford University).
According to the holographic principle, all the information in the entire universe can be described on a giant imaginary sphere around it. Verlinde now shows that this idea is not quite correct—part of the information in our universe is contained in space itself.
This extra information is required to describe that other dark component of the universe: Dark energy, which is believed to be responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe.
Investigating the effects of this additional information on ordinary matter, Verlinde comes to a stunning conclusion. Whereas ordinary gravity can be encoded using the information on the imaginary sphere around the universe, as he showed in his 2010 work, the result of the additional information in the bulk of space is a force that nicely matches that attributed to dark matter.
Gravity is in dire need of new approaches like the one by Verlinde, since it doesn't combine well with quantum physics. Both theories, crown jewels of 20th century physics, cannot be true at the same time. The problems arise in extreme conditions: near black holes, or during the Big Bang.
"Many theoretical physicists like me are working on a revision of the theory, and some major advancements have been made," says Verlinde. "We might be standing on the brink of a new scientific revolution that will radically change our views on the very nature of space, time and gravity."

The report shows how people are overpowering the planet for the first time in Earth’s history and highlights the changes needed in the way society is fed and fuelled.</p>

  <p>(University of California - Berkeley) UC Berkeley and Exeter University researchers propose a novel strategy to keep malarial mosquitoes out of people’s homes: combine a repellent with an insecticide. The strategy uses evolution to drive mosquitoes to greater aversion to the repellent, and lowers the push by mosquitoes to develop resistance, thus extending insecticide lifetime. Efforts to find effective repellents don’t need to wait for a good candidate. The strategy can turn a mediocre repellent into a good one.</p>
