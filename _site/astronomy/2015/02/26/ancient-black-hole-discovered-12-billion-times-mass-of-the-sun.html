<meta name="description" content="Extract                  Astronomers have found a huge black hole which was powering the brightest object in the early universe. The black hole’s mass is 12 billion solar masses, and the surrounding quasar pumped out 10^15 times the sun’s energy. An international team of astronomers have found a huge and ancient black hole which was powering the brightest object early in the universe. “Forming such a large black hole so quickly is hard to interpret with current theories,” said Fuyan Bian, from the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Australian National University. Bian said the discovery challenges theories of how black holes form and grow in the early universe. The black hole’s mass is 12 billion times that of the Sun, and it lives at the centre of a quasar that pumped out a million billion times the energy of our Sun. A quasar is an extremely bright cloud of material in the process of being sucked into a black hole. As the material accelerates towards the black hole it heats up, emitting an extraordinary amount of light which actually pushes away material falling behind it. This process, known as radiation pressure, is thought to limit the growth rate of black holes, Dr Bian said. “However this black hole at the centre of the quasar gained enormous mass in a short period of time,” Dr Bian said. The black hole that powers this new quasar is four thousand times heavier than ours. SDSS J0100+2802 is also seven times brighter than the most distant quasar known (which is 13 billion years away) making it one of the most distant quasars discovered. The quasar was discovered using data from the 2.4 metre Lijiang Telescope (LJT) in China, the 6.5m Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT), and the 8.4m Large Binocular Telescope (LBTO) in USA, the 6.5m Magellan Telescope in Las Campanas Observatory, Chile, and the 8.2m Gemini North Telescope in Hawaii. The newly discovered quasar SDSS J0100+2802 is the one with the most massive black hole and the highest luminosity among all known distant quasars. Image credit: Zhaoyu Li/Yunnan Observatory.     Quasars evolved only about nine hundred million years after the Big Bang, close to the end of the cosmic dawn when light from the earliest generations of galaxies and quasars were thought to transformed the Universe. So how can a quasar so luminous, and a black hole so massive, form so early in the history of the Universe? “This ultra-luminous quasar with a 12-billion solar mass black hole provides a unique laboratory to the study of the mass assembly and galaxy formation around the most massive black hole at early Universe,” said Professor Xiaohui Fan from Steward Observatory, the University of Arizona, in a statement. “This quasar is unique. We are so excited, when we found that there is such luminous and massive quasar only 0.9 billion years after the Big Bang. Just like the brightest lighthouse in the distant universe, its glowing light will help us to probe more about the early universe,” Professor Xue-Bing Wu at Peking University, who led the team, also stated. The research team will carry out further investigations on the quasar with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Telescope. Dr Bian expects more surprising objects will be discovered during the Skymapper survey of the southern skies, currently being run by the ANU. “Skymapper will find more of these exciting objects. Because they are so luminous we can see further back in time and can use them to explore the early universe,” Dr Bian said.  The biggest known black hole in the universe weighs in with a mass of 18 billion Suns, and is about the size of an entire galaxy. This monster black hole has a puny twin hovering nearby. By observing the orbit of the smaller black hole, astronomers were able to test Einstein’s theory of general relativity with stronger gravitational fields than ever before. The biggest black hole beats out its nearest competitor by six times. Fortunately, it’s 3.5 billion light years away, forming the heart of a quasar called OJ287.  The team led by Xue-Bing Wu at Peking University, China, selected the quasar from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey of over 500 million objects in the northern skies, because of its distinctive red color. They then followed up with three other telescopes to study the object in detail.

Quasars evolved only about nine hundred million years after the Big Bang, close to the end of the cosmic dawn when light from the earliest generations of galaxies and quasars were thought to transformed the Universe.
