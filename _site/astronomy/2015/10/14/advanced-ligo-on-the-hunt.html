  <p>What exciting new discoveries await astronomers in the field of gravitational wave astronomy?

A new-and-improved gravitational wave observatory is open for business. After a five-year-long upgrade, the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (ALIGO) resumed its search for gravitational waves on September 18, 2015. In this first run, its sensitivity is already three times that of the initial LIGO project’s best run, and eventually it will be running at ten times the sensitivity.
When any massive body accelerates through spacetime, it acts like a paddle moving through water, generating ripples known as gravitational waves. The more massive the body and the faster it moves, the larger the ripple. But even though they’re expected from the theory of general relativity and indirectly detected in pulsar observations, gravitational waves have eluded direct detection so far. ALIGO might fix that predicament.
“It is incredibly exciting — and satisfying — to see the planning, designing, building, testing, installing, and commissioning of Advanced LIGO come together so successfully. Kudos to the whole team!” David Shoemaker, director of the MIT LIGO Laboratory, said in a press release.
The original LIGO was built to detect gravitational waves from mergers of neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes. It didn’t succeed, but it never had the capability to detect anything beyond the most powerful sources. Now, with their improved sensitivity, the new ALIGO detectors could spot inspiraling binary systems 3.5 times farther away than the original LIGO project — that’s as far as 225 million light-years away.

Astronomers have been attempting to detect gravitational waves directly since the 1960s, even before indirect evidence from pulsars supported their existence. But LIGO, a $620 million project, detected nothing in its years of operation between 2002 and 2010.
To some extent, this result was expected — detection was considered plausible for LIGO, but not likely. And to some extent, this result was useful. For example, by not detecting the primordial gravitational waves that would have been generated in the Big Bang, LIGO ruled out some more exotic versions of the theory of cosmic inflation, which describes how the universe expanded shortly after the Big Bang.
Moreover, LIGO showed that detection could be done. Scientists periodically inserted artificial signals, known as blind injections, into the data, and they were able to recover these artificial signals. If a real, loud-enough signal had passed by, LIGO would have heard it. Now, with ALIGO, the probability of detection moves from plausible to likely.
While the first direct detection of gravitational waves would surely garner scientific accolades, a non-detection from ALIGO could prove just as fruitful — not seeing anything this time around would send theorists back to the drawing board.
The Future of Gravitational Wave Astronomy

Though this mission won’t detect gravitational waves themselves, it’s designed to test key technologies for a full mission known as eLISA (short for “evolved” LISA), which might launch sometime in the 2030s.
LIGO India will also utilize technology from a planned-for, but never-built, third LIGO array stored at the Hanford facility. Engineers expect LIGO-India to be operational in the early 2020s, and its observations will further the existing LIGO capabilities.
Looking to hunt for gravitational waves yourself? You can enlist your computer’s idle time to run Einstein@Home. Similar to the famous SETI@Home, this new project sifts through data from LIGO, Arecibo, and the Parkes Multibeam Survey to search for radio pulsars and continuous gravitational wave sources. Though Einstein@Home users haven’t detected gravitational waves yet, they have discovered 51 new pulsars as of February. And who knows what the future holds in store?
