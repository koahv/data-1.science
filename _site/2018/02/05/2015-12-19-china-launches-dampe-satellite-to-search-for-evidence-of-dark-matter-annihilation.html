 China’s space science efforts got a boost today with the launch of the first of four planned scientific missions. The Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) rode into space on a Long March 2D rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi desert, about 1600 kilometers west of Beijing, at about 8:12 a.m. local time.
 “This is an exciting mission,” says theoretical astrophysicist David Spergel of Princeton University. If dark matter annihilates, as some theories predict, “DAMPE has an opportunity to detect dark matter annihilation products,” Spergel says. The launch also marks China’s new commitment to scientific space missions. “DAMPE is the first Chinese space mission for astronomy and astrophysics,” says Yizhong Fan,…</p>
