 Google DeepMind’s artificial intelligence team, along with researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, has trained AI machines to interact with objects in order to evaluate their properties without any prior awareness of physical laws. The team set about various trials in different virtual environments in which the AI was faced with a series of blocks and tasked with assessing their properties.
 Advances in artificial intelligence have yielded intelligent machines that can achieve superhuman performance in Go, Atari, natural language processing, and complex control problems,but it is not clear that these systems can rival the scientific intuition of even a young child. The new reserach embraced the view in developmental s…</p>
