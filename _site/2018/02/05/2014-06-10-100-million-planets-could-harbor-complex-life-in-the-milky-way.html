 “The evolution of complex life on other worlds is rare in frequency but large in absolute number,” according to new research from a team led by Louis Irwin—from the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Texas at El Paso. Their findings are based on the first plausible “assessment of complex life in the Universe using empirical data.”
 The team developed Biological Complexity Index (BCI), designed to provide a quantitative estimate of the relative probability that complex, macro-organismic life forms could have emerged on other worlds. Their calculation in the Milky Way alone is mind-bending: 100 million worlds in our home galaxy may harbor complex alien life. And the Milky Way is one of some 500 billion galaxies in the Un…</p>
