 “It is quite surprising that gravity can play any role in quantum mechanics”, says Igor Pikovski, a theoretical physicist working at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics:”Gravity is usually studied on astronomical scales, but it seems that it also alters the quantum nature of the smallest particles on Earth”. “It remains to be seen what the results imply on cosmological scales, where gravity can be much stronger”, adds Caslav Brukner University Professor at the University of Vienna and Director of the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information.
 In 1915 Albert Einstein formulated the theory of general relativity which fundamentally changed our understanding of gravity. He explained gravity as the manifestatio…</p>
