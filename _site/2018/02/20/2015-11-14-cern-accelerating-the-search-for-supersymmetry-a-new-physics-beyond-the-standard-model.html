 “The Higgs mass that we measure is consistent with the Standard Model if the parameters of the model are carefully tuned to something like 30 decimal places,” said Joe Incandela, a UC Santa Barbara physics professor and scientist in CERN’s Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, one of four detectors located along the LHC 16-mile collider tunnel. “This seems very unnatural to us. When you introduce new physics, like supersymmetry, things come into balance and you do not have to tune anymore. We’re trying to find the evidence for supersymmetry for this reason, and because we know there’s dark matter, which is also predicted in supersymmetry models. So all in all, we’re looking for the bridge to the next chapter of the story.”
