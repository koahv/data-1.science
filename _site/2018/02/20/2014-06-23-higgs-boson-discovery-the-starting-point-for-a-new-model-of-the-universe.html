Finding the Higgs particle wasn’t the end of the story. It was the starting point on a new horizon.”
 A recently published study in the journal Nature Physics reports scientists have found evidence that the Higgs boson — a fundamental particle proposed in 1964 and discovered in 2012 — is the long sought-after particle responsible for giving mass to elementary particles.
