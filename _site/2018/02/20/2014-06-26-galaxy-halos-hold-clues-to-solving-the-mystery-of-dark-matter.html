 The hunt for dark matter has taken another step forward thanks to new supercomputer simulations showing the evolution of our “local Universe” from the Big Bang to the present day. Physicists say their simulations could improve understanding of dark matter, the mysterious substance believed to make up 85 per cent of the mass of the Universe.
 “I’ve been losing sleep over this for the last 30 years. Dark matter is the key to everything we know about galaxies, but we still don’t know its exact nature,” said Carlos Frenk, Director of Durham University’s Institute for Computational Cosmology. “Understanding how galaxies formed holds the key to the dark matter mystery.”
 Scientists believe clumps of dark matter – or halos – that emerged f…</p>
