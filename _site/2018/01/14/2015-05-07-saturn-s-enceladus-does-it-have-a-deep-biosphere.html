 “The reaction between the metallic rocks and the ocean water produces molecular hydrogen (H2) provides a source of chemical energy that is essential for supporting a deep biosphere in the absence of sunlight inside moons and planets,” said Christopher Glein of the Carnegie Institute. “This process is central to the emerging science of astrobiology, because molecular hydrogen can both drive the formation of organic compounds like amino acids that may lead to the origin of life, and serve as food for microbial life such as methane-producing organisms. As such, serpentinization provides a link between geological processes and biological processes. The discovery of serpentinization makes Enceladus an even more promising candidate for a separate genesis of life.”
 New research led by Glein has revealed the pH of water spewing from a geyser-like plume on Saturn’s moon Enceladus. Their findings are an important step toward determining whether life could exist, or could have previou…</p>
