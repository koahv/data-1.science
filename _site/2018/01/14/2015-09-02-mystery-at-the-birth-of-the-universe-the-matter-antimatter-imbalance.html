 What did the universe look like shortly after it came into being? The ALICE experiment (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) at CERN in Switzerland concerns itself with this question. At the largest particle accelerator in the world, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), researchers let lead nuclei and protons collide at the highest beam energies to date. The temperatures thereby created are 100,000 times higher than those in the center of the Sun.
 “A state is created that is very similar to the one after the Big Bang,” explains Laura Fabbietti, Professor in the Physics Department. She and Dr. Torsten Dahms head the two experimental ALICE groups at the TU Munich.
 The so-called quark-gluon-plasma (QGP) probably formed one microsecond after the Big Bang, a point in time when the universe was expanding at great speed. The QGP produced in the laboratory is stable only for a fraction of a second, but, during this very short time, the researchers have the opportunity to look back into…</p>
