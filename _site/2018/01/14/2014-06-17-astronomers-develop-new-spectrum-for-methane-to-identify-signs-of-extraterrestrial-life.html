 A powerful new model to detect life on planets outside of our solar system, more accurately than ever before, has been developed by UCL (University College London) researchers. The new model focuses on methane, the simplest organic molecule, widely acknowledged to be a sign of potential life.
 Researchers from UCL and the University of New South Wales have developed a new spectrum for ‘hot’ methane which can be used to detect the molecule at temperatures above that of Earth, up to 1,500K/1220°C – something which was not possible before.
 To find out what remote planets orbiting other stars are made of, astronomers analyzee the way in which their atmospheres absorb starlight of different colors and compare it to a model, or ‘spectrum’, to identify different molecules.
 “Current models of methane are incomplete, leading to a severe underestimation of methane levels on planets,” said Jonathan Tennyson, (UCL Department of Physics and Astronomy) co-author of the study. “We anticipat…</p>
