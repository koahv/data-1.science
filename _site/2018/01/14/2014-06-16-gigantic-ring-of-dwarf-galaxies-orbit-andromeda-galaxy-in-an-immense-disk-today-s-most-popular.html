 A gigantic ring dwarf galaxies were found dancing in a ring around the much larger Andromeda Galaxy in early 2013. The finding presents a challenge to our ideas of how all galaxies form and evolve. The surprising research result reveals that around half of Andromeda’s 30-odd known dwarf galaxy satellites are orbiting the larger Andromeda Galaxy – the closest giant cosmic neighbor to our Milky Way.
 “Astronomers have been observing Andromeda since Persian astronomers first noted it over a thousand years ago, but it is only in the past decade that we have truly studied it in exquisite detail with the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey,” said Geraint Lewis from the University of Sydney’s School of Physics. “The Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey – cutely called PAndAS – is a large project that ran between 2008 and 2011, using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope situated on the Mauna Kea volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii.
