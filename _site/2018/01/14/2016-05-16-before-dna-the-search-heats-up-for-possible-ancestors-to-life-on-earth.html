 All life on Earth uses DNA to encode and store genes, and to pass them on from one generation to the next. RNA, a close molecular relative of DNA, is used within living cells to carryout a wide variety of important biological functions, including protein synthesis.
 DNA and RNA are both extremely complex molecules, a fact that has fueled a long-standing debate about the origins of life. RNA looks potentially older and more versatile than DNA, so many scientists believe that RNA came before DNA. But did life begin with RNA, or was there something even simpler that preceded it?
 Scientists have found it difficult to deduce the chemical environment on early Earth when life began. Nevertheless, there have been a number of notable successes in this area of research, including the discovery of reactions that produce the building blocks of RNA. However, a reaction that produces actual polymers of RNA has not been found, causing many scientists to conclude that RNA is the product of…</p>
