The team of astrophysicists led by John Kovac of Harvard who announced just months ago what they acheived a breakthrough in confirming how the universe was born when they identified gravitational waves that rippled through space right after the Big Bang now admit they may be wrong. The detection was made with the help of a telescope called BICEP2, stationed at the South Pole. BICEP2 stands for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization. If proven to be correctly identified, these waves – predicted in Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity – would confirm the rapid and violent growth spurt of the universe in the first fraction of a second marking its existence, 13.8 billion years ago.
The apparent first direct evidence of such so-called cosmic inflation – a theory that the universe expanded by 100 trillion trillion times in barely the blink of an eye – was announced in March by experts at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
“Detecting this signal is one of the most important goals in cosmology today,” John Kovac, leader of the BICEP2 collaboration at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said at the time. By observing the cosmic microwave background, or a faint glow left over from the Big Bang, the scientists said small fluctuations gave them new clues about the conditions in the early universe.
By observing the cosmic microwave background, or a faint glow left over from the Big Bang, the scientists said small fluctuations gave them new clues about the conditions in the early universe. The gravitational waves rippled through the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, and these images were captured by the telescope, they claimed. If confirmed by other experts, some said the work could be a contender for the Nobel Prize.
After weeks in which they avoided the media, the team published its work last Thursday in the US journal Physical Review Letters. The team concluded that their models “are not sufficiently constrained by external public data to exclude the possibility of dust emission bright enough to explain the entire excess signal,” as stated by other scientists who questioned their conclusion.
Paul Steinhardt, director of Princeton University’s Center for Theoretical Science, addressed the issue in the prestigious British journal Nature in early June. “Serious flaws in the analysis have been revealed that transform the sure detection into no detection,” Steinhardt wrote, citing an independent analysis of the BICEP2 findings.
That analysis was carried out by David Spergel, a theoretical astrophysicist who is also at Princeton. Spergel queried whether what the BICEP2 telescope picked up really came from the first moments of the universe’s existence. “What I think, it is not certain whether polarized emissions come from galactic dust or from the early universe,” he told AFP.
When using just one frequency, as these scientists did, it is impossible to distinguish between gravitational waves and galactic emissions, Spergel added.
“We know that galactic dust emits polarized radiations. We see that in many areas of the sky, and what we pointed out in our paper is that pattern they have seen is just as consistent with the galactic dust radiations as with gravitational waves,” Spergel told AFP last week. He added that the question will likely be settled in the coming months when another, competing group, working with the European Space Agency’s Planck telescope, publishes its results.
That telescope observes a large part of the sky – versus the BICEP2’s two percent – and carries out measurements in six frequencies, compared to just one for BICEP2, according to Spergel. “I think in retrospect, they should have been more careful about making a big announcement,” he said.
Philipp Mertsch of the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at Stanford University said data from Planck and another team should be able to “shed more light on whether it is primordial gravitational waves or dust in the Milky Way. Let me stress, however, that what is leaving me (and many of my colleagues) unsatisfied with the state of affairs: If it is polarized dust emission, where is it coming from?” he said in an email to AFP.
