 The first images taken by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) after the survey began in August 2013 have revealed a rare, ‘superluminous’ supernova that erupted in a galaxy 7.8 billion light years away. The stellar explosion, called DES13S2cmm, easily outshines most galaxies in the Universe and could still be seen in the data six months later, at the end of the first of what will be five years of observing by DES. The event was discovered by Andreas Papadopoulos, a postgraduate student from the University of Portsmouth, who will present the discovery at the National Astronomy Meeting 2014 in Portsmouth today, Wednesday, 25 June.
 Superluminous supernovae are a recent discovery, only being recognized as a distinct class of objects in the past 5 years. These cosmic explosions are 10-50 times brighter at their peak than the brightest normal type of supernovae and, unlike other supernovae, their explosive origins remain a mystery.
 “Fewer than forty such supernovae have ever been found an…</p>
