 “We don’t know how many planets we’re going to have to examine before we find life, and not finding it on 10 or 100 doesn’t mean it’s not there,” John Grunsfeld, NASA’s associate administrator for the science mission directorate said during the panel. “This may be very tricky.”
 “We can’t really tell what life is,” MIT astrophysicist and exoplanet hunter Sara Seager said. “All we can do is work with what life does. Life metabolizes and generates gasses, so that’s what we’re looking for … The good news is, whatever life is, as long as it uses chemistry, we’re all set. We’ll have the capabilit…</p>
