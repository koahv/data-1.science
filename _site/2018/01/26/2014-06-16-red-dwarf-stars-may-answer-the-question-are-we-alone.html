 Six percent of red-dwarf stars have habitable, Earth-sized planets, astronomers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) have found. Red dwarfs are the most common stars in our galaxy; about 75 percent of the closest stars to Earth are red dwarfs. The closest Earth-like planet could be just 13 light-years away, Harvard astronomer Courtney Dressing has calculated. Since red dwarf stars live much longer than Sun-like stars, this discovery raises the interesting possibility that life on such a planet would be much older and more evolved than life on Earth.
 “They are the silent majority, a population historically underrepresented, meaning unstudied,” says Andrew West, assistant professor in Boston University’s department of astronomy. “Despite being ubiquitous, they are very faint, making them challenging to observe.”
 West is convinced that the resulting information will help us learn how all stars form, and may provide “a small piece of the puzzle of trying to un…</p>
