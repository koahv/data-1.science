Two separate experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, on the French-Swiss border, appear to confirm the existence of a subatomic particle, the Madala boson, that for the first time could shed light on one of the great mysteries of the universe - dark matter.
The Madala boson follows the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 “but the particles differ remarkably,” said the team leader Bruce Mellado of South Africa’s Witwatersrand University School of Physics. The Madala boson is heavier and disintegrates into the Higgs boson. “The Higgs boson in the Standard Model of physics is not able to explain several things, such as dark matter,” Mellado added.
“The Madala boson is important for our understanding of the universe. Through this we can communicate with dark matter - we don’t have an object that can do that. This could be the first,” said Mellado. The boson appears to interact with energy that cannot be explained.
Mellado will summarize the reappearance of these features in the features in the proton-proton collision data collected during Run I by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider that were used to formulate the Madala hypothesis, and its implications.
These features in the data were interpreted as being due to the existence of a new scalar, the Madala boson, with a mass around 270 GeV. A conservative statistical combination yielded a three sigma effect. The ATLAS and CMS collaboration have just released new data at the international conference ICHEP2016.
In particular, Mellado will discuss a prediction, namely of the production of anomalously large 4 W bosons, leading to a striking and unequivocal signature.
Dark matter is the new frontier in physics, Mellado said, and scientists were racing to work out what it is. The Chinese and Japanese had declared intentions of building colliders that could be used to search for the identity of dark matter and dark energy. A team of 35 University of the Witwatersrand scientists today hosts a series of seminars about the Madala boson (Zulu for “old”), followed by other seminars in the US, UK, China and India.
