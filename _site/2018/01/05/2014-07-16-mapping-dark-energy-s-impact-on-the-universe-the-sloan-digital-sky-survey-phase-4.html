The next phase of a global drive to map the night sky will bring the cosmos into greater focus than at any in human history. Already, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey has registered more than half a million stars in the Milky Way (a portion of which is shown in the image above) and more than two million galaxies and quasars. The new, fourth phase of the survey broadens the project’s scope and will dramatically expand its database. A major component will focus on mapping the distribution of galaxies and quasars from 3 to 8 billion years ago. During that period, dark energy began to have an impact on the universe.
“The power of a large survey is that there may be surprises we weren’t planning on, and that means learning something really new,” said C. Megan Urry, Yale’s Israel Munson Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics and director of the Yale Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics.
“One of the things my group is really excited about is the possibility of getting more information about black holes growing in distant galaxies, including the most luminous ones, known as quasars,” Urry said. “By surveying a very large fraction of the available sky, SDSS IV will greatly increase our knowledge about when and where the most massive black holes grow.”
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is an initiative that spans four continents and includes 200 astronomers at more than 40 institutions. They will chart thousands of nearby galaxies, probe the composition of stars throughout the Milky Way with novel clarity, and measure the expansion of the universe during a particularly murky period.
Survey officials announced the fourth phase of the effort on July 15. It will make use of not only the Sloan Foundation 2.5-meter Telescope in New Mexico, but also the 2.5-meter Irenee du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.
       
         
 
This phase has three new components. One will be to create much more detailed maps of nearby galaxies, thanks to an optical fiber bundle technology that takes spectra of each part of a galaxy simultaneously. Another effort will use the Chilean telescope to monitor the makeup and movement of stars throughout the Milky Way that cannot be observed from New Mexico.
“When people ask me what I do I say I’m helping to map the universe,” said John K. Parejko, a postdoctoral research associate at Yale and operations software developer for the sky survey. “It’s not just that we’ll have incredibly more data than ever before, but that the quality and uniformity of the data will be unrivaled for years to come.”
With such a map, scientists can retrace the history of the Universe over the last six billion years. With that history, they can get better estimates for how much of the Universe is made up of dark matter - matter that we can’t directly see because it doesn’t emit or absorb light - and dark energy, the even more mysterious force that drives the accelerating expansion of the Universe.
“Dark matter and dark energy are two of the greatest mysteries of our time,” said David Schlegel of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, who led the earlier SDSS-III effort to map these galaxies and quasars. “We’re confident this new map will guide us, or someone else, in solving these mysteries.”
That map of the Universe is the centerpiece of DR9 shown in the image at the top of page. Data Release 9 (DR9) was the latest data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Data Release 9 was the first release of the spectra from the SDSS-III’s Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), which includes more than 800,000 spectra over 3,300 square degrees of sky, observed with the new 1,000-fiber BOSS spectrograph.It included new spectra from 540,000 galaxies from when the Universe was half its present age. A spectrum is a measure of light from a galaxy at different wavelengths; from this information we can measure the distances to those galaxies. This distance information provides the third dimension in the DR9 map, providing a more detailed view of the structure of the Universe than has been measured before.
Quasars provide further details to the three dimensional map and another way to measure the distribution of matter in the Universe. Quasars are the brightest objects in the distant Universe, and their spectra reveal intricate patterns imprinted by the intergalactic gas and underlying dark matter that lies between each quasar and the Earth.
The data in DR9 are not only helping us understand the distant Universe, but also our own cosmic backyard, the Milky Way galaxy. DR9 includes better estimates for the chemical compositions of more than half a million stars in our own galaxy. “With these better estimates, we can look back at the history of our galaxy,” said Connie Rockosi of the University of California Santa Cruz, who led the SDSS- III’s Milky Way study.
