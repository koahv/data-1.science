 Earlier this year, astronomers discovered what appeared to be a pair of supermassive black holes circling toward a collision so powerful it would send a burst of gravitational waves surging through the fabric of space-time itself.
 Astronomers at Columbia University have provided evidence that a pair of closely orbiting black holes is causing the rhythmic flashes of light coming from quasar PG 1302-102. Based on calculations of the pair’s mass–together, and relative to each other–the researchers go on to predict a smashup 100,000 years from now, an impossibly long time to humans but the blink of an eye to a star or black hole. Spiraling together 3.5 billion light-years away, deep in the Virgo constellation, the pair is separated by a mere light-week. By contrast, the closest previously confirmed black hole pair is separated by 20 light-years.
 “This is the closest we’ve come to observing two black holes on their way to a massive collision,” said the study’s senior autho…</p>
