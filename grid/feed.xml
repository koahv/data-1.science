The universe will always be much richer than our ability to understand it.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Exactly eight years later, a mind far more scientifically formidable, if not as poetic, ignited in the popular imagination the idea that Sagan&rsquo;s worldview might be wrong &mdash; that the universe might, after all, be fully knowable and fully describable in a single elegant theory. </p>
<p>When <strong>Stephen Hawking</strong> (January 8, 1942&ndash;March 14, 2018) sent his book proposal for what would become <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Time-Black-Holes/dp/0857501003/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/brief-history-of-time/oclc/1005987912&amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>public library</em></a>) to Cambridge University Press &mdash; his first book of popular science &mdash; his editors cautioned him that it contained too much science to be sellable. Every equation, they admonished, would cut book sales in half. Hawking revised the manuscript until it contained a single equation &mdash; Einstein&rsquo;s <em>E = mc<sup>2</sup></em>. He transmuted all the remaining equations into a scintillating scientific narrative and completed the book just before he rallied Cambridge into a celebration of the 300th anniversary of Newton&rsquo;s <em>Principia</em> &mdash; perhaps the most paradigm-shifting book in the history of science, introducing the theory of gravitation to the world.</p>

<p><em>A Brief History of Time</em> was published on April Fool&rsquo;s Day 1988. In the introduction, Carl Sagan extolled Hawking as a &ldquo;worthy successor&rdquo; to Newton and lauded the book as replete with &ldquo;lucid revelations on the frontiers of physics, astronomy, cosmology and courage.&rdquo; Its accelerated ascent up the bestseller list stunned even Hawking himself. Within months, millions of copies had sold and the book was being translated into multiple languages &mdash; success so rapid that it entered the <em>Guinness Book of World Records</em>. (Hawking was amused that his American-made speech synthesizer struggled with the word, pronouncing it <em>Guy-ness</em>.) A &ldquo;phenomenal international bestseller&rdquo; for decades to come, in the words inscribed on the cover of the most current edition at the time of Hawking&rsquo;s death, <em>A Brief History of Time</em> went on to shape the way generations comprehend the universe. </p>
<p>One of the most abiding aspects of the book is Hawking&rsquo;s succinct description of what makes a good theory. In a sense, it parallels pioneering psychologist Jerome Bruner&rsquo;s framework of <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/01/20/jerome-bruner-actual-minds-possible-worlds-storytelling/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">what makes a good story</a>. With an eye to Karl Popper&rsquo;s famous assertion that <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/01/26/karl-popper-in-search-of-a-better-world-truth-certainty/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&ldquo;knowledge consists in the search for truth&hellip; not the search for certainty,&rdquo;</a> Hawking writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Any physical theory is always provisional, in the sense that it is only a hypothesis: you can never prove it. No matter how many times the results of experiments agree with some theory, you can never be sure that the next time the result will not contradict the theory. On the other hand, you can disprove a theory by finding even a single observation that disagrees with the predictions of the theory. As philosopher of science Karl Popper has emphasized, a good theory is characterized by the fact that it makes a number of predictions that could in principle be disproved or falsified by observation. Each time new experiments are observed to agree with the predictions the theory survives, and our confidence in it is increased; but if ever a new observation is found to disagree, we have to abandon or modify the theory.</p></blockquote>

<p>In her excellent biography, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stephen-Hawking-Unfettered-Kitty-Ferguson/dp/1250139368/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>Stephen Hawking: An Unfettered Mind</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/stephen-hawking-an-unfettered-mind/oclc/989106294&amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>public library</em></a>), Kitty Ferguson builds upon Hawking&rsquo;s formulation of a good theory and offers her own, more expansive and poetic definition:</p>
<blockquote><p>A theory is not Truth with a capital <em>T</em>, not a rule, not fact, not the final word. You might think of a theory as a toy boat. To find out whether it floats, you set it on the water. You test it. When it flounders, you pull it out of the water and make some changes, or you start again and build a different boat, benefiting from what you&rsquo;ve learned from the failure. </p>
<p>Some theories are good boats. They float a long time. We may know there are a few leaks, but for all practical purposes they serve us well. Some serve us so well, and are so solidly supported by experiment and testing, that we begin to regard them as truth. Scientists, keeping in mind how complex and surprising our universe is, are extremely wary about calling them that. Although some theories do have a lot of experimental success to back them up and others are hardly more than a glimmer in a theorist&rsquo;s eyes &mdash; brilliantly designed boats that have never been tried on the water &mdash; it is risky to assume that any of them is an absolute, fundamental scientific &ldquo;truth.&rdquo; </p>
<p>It is important, however, not to dither around forever, continuing to call into question well-established theories without having a good reason for doing so. For science to move ahead, it is necessary to decide whether some theories are dependable enough, and match observation sufficiently well, to allow us to use them as building blocks and proceed from there. Of course, some new thought or discovery might come along and threaten to sink the boat.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hawking&rsquo;s own life was animated by one particular theoretical pursuit &mdash; the search for a theory, colloquially known as a <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/09/25/stephen-hawking-made-simple-animation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&ldquo;theory of everything,&rdquo;</a> that unifies Einstein&rsquo;s general relativity, the gravity-based science of the very large, and quantum mechanics, the science of the very small, based on three non-gravitational forces: the weak, strong, and electromagnetic forces. In the penultimate chapter of <em>A Brief History of Time</em>, Hawking considers this unholy grail of physics against the backdrop of the history of science:</p>
<blockquote><p>The prospects for finding such a theory seem to be much better now because we know so much more about the universe. But we must beware of overconfidence &mdash; we have had false dawns before! At the beginning of this century, for example, it was thought that everything could be explained in terms of the properties of continuous matter, such as elasticity and heat conduction. The discovery of atomic structure and the uncertainty principle put an emphatic end to that. Then again, in 1928, physicist and Nobel Prize winner Max Born told a group of visitors to G&ouml;ttingen University, &ldquo;Physics, as we know it, will be over in six months.&rdquo; His confidence was based on the recent discovery by Dirac of the equation that governed the electron. It was thought that a similar equation would govern the proton, which was the only other particle known at the time, and that would be the end of theoretical physics. However, the discovery of the neutron and of nuclear forces knocked that one on the head too. Having said this, I still believe there are grounds for cautious optimism that we may now be near the end of the search for the ultimate laws of nature.</p></blockquote>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Investigating inside the human body often requires cutting open a patient or swallowing long tubes with built-in cameras. But what if physicians&nbsp;could get a better glimpse in a&nbsp;less expensive, invasive, and time-consuming manner?</p>





<p>A team from MIT&rsquo;s <a href="http://csail.mit.edu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a> (CSAIL) led by Professor Dina Katabi is working on doing exactly that with an &ldquo;in-body GPS" system dubbed&nbsp;ReMix. The new method can pinpoint the location of ingestible implants inside the body using low-power wireless signals. These implants could be used as&nbsp;tiny tracking devices on shifting tumors to help monitor&nbsp;their slight movements.</p>

<p>In animal tests, the team demonstrated that they can track the implants with centimeter-level accuracy. The team says that, one day, similar implants could be used to deliver drugs to specific regions in the body.</p>

<p>ReMix was developed in collaboration with researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The team describes the system in a paper that's being presented at this week's Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Data Communications (SIGCOMM) conference in Budapest, Hungary.</p>

<div></div>

<p><strong>Tracking inside the body</strong></p>

<p>To test ReMix, Katabi&rsquo;s group first implanted a small marker in animal tissues. To track its movement, the researchers used a wireless device that reflects radio signals off the patient.&nbsp;This was based on a wireless technology that the researchers previously demonstrated to detect <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/detecting-emotions-with-wireless-signals-0920" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">heart rate</a>, <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2014/could-wireless-replace-wearables" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">breathing</a>, and <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2017/dina-katabi-csail-team-develop-wireless-system-to-detect-walking-speeds-0501" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">movement</a>. A special algorithm then uses that signal to pinpoint the exact location of the marker.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the marker inside the body does not need to transmit any wireless signal. It simply reflects the signal transmitted by the wireless device outside the body. Therefore, it doesn't need a battery or any other external source of energy.</p>

<p>A key challenge in using wireless signals in this way is the many competing reflections that bounce off a person's body. In fact, the signals that reflect off a person&rsquo;s skin are actually 100 million times more powerful than the signals of the metal marker itself.</p>

<p>To overcome this, the team designed an approach that essentially separates the interfering skin signals from the ones they're trying to measure. They did this using a small semiconductor device, called a &ldquo;diode,&rdquo; that mixes signals together so the team can then filter out the skin-related signals. For example, if the skin reflects at frequencies of F1 and F2, the diode creates new combinations of those frequencies, such as F1-F2 and F1+F2. When all of the signals reflect back to the system, the system only picks up the combined frequencies, filtering out the original frequencies that came from the patient&rsquo;s skin.</p>

<p>One potential application for ReMix is in proton therapy, a type of cancer treatment that involves bombarding tumors with beams of magnet-controlled protons. The approach allows doctors to prescribe higher doses of radiation, but requires a very high degree of precision, which means that it&rsquo;s usually limited to only certain cancers.</p>

<p>Its success hinges on something that's actually quite unreliable: a tumor staying exactly where it is during the radiation process. If a tumor moves, then healthy areas could be exposed to the radiation. But with a small marker like ReMix&rsquo;s, doctors could better determine the location of a tumor in real-time and either pause the treatment or steer the beam into the right position. (To be clear, ReMix is not yet accurate enough to be used in clinical settings. Katabi says a margin of error closer to a couple of millimeters would be necessary for actual implementation.)</p>

<p>"The ability to continuously sense inside the human body has largely been a distant dream," says Romit Roy Choudhury, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Illinois, who was not involved in the research. "One of the roadblocks has been wireless communication to a device and its continuous localization. ReMix makes a leap in this direction by showing that the wireless component of implantable devices may no longer be the bottleneck."</p>

<p><strong>Looking ahead</strong></p>

<p>There are still many ongoing challenges for improving ReMix. The team next hopes to combine the wireless data with medical data, such as that from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, to further improve the system&rsquo;s accuracy. In addition, the team will continue to reassess the algorithm and the various tradeoffs needed to account for the complexity of different bodies.</p>

<p>"We want a model that's technically feasible, while still complex enough to accurately represent the human body," says MIT PhD student Deepak Vasisht, lead author on the new paper. "If we want to use this technology on actual cancer patients one day, it will have to come from better modeling a person's physical structure."</p>

<p>The researchers say that such systems could help enable more widespread adoption of proton therapy centers. Today, there are only about 100 centers globally.</p>

<p>"One reason that [proton therapy] is so expensive is because of the cost of installing the hardware," Vasisht says. "If these systems can encourage more applications of the technology, there will be more demand, which will mean more therapy centers, and lower prices for patients."</p>

	<title type="html">Climate Change Is Acidifying Our Lakes and Rivers the Same Way It Does With Oceans</title>
	<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Acidifying Water

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Acidifying Water</h2>
<p>Earth&rsquo;s oceans <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/feb/16/scientists-study-ocean-absorption-of-human-carbon-pollution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">absorb about 40%</a> of all the carbon dioxide (CO2) that humans emit into the atmosphere. That CO2 then acidifies the water and is known to harm marine wildlife, especially shellfish, in a well-documented phenomenon known as ocean acidification. Yet according to a new study <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-%209822(17)31655-X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published in </a><i><a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-%209822(17)31655-X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Current Biology</a>, </i>ocean waters are not the only bodies of water that are affected by CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>Researchers showed that, over the course of 35 years, four reservoirs in Germany had both a significant increase in CO2 and a related decrease in pH, with waters dropping by about 0.3. (pH runs on a scale of 1 to 14, with 1 being the most acidic and 14 being the most basic.) They detected these changes from data from the local Ruhr region agency, which monitors drinking water, over the years 1981 to 2015.</p>
<p>Through these records, the team was able to determine that CO2 levels were rising by noting changes in temperature, water density, pH, ion species distribution, and inorganic content.</p>
<figure><img src="https://futurism.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/lake-1200x800.jpg" alt="Freshwater bodies like this pristine mountain lake are affected by CO2 emissions, causing acidification and negatively affecting animals." width="1200" height="800"><figcaption>Image Credit: Makalu / Pixabay</figcaption></figure>
<p>Until now, the study of freshwater acidification has been difficult at best. This is because showing how the impact of carbon dioxide on ecosystems demands complicated modeling, and results are typically less clear than when studying ocean systems.</p>
<h2>Wildlife Danger</h2>
<p>It is likely, according to this study, that freshwater systems absorb CO2 in different ways than oceans do. While the details of these processes are not the same between fresh and saltwater bodies,&nbsp;they share an ability to<a href="https://futurism.com/marine-food-webs-brink-collapse-because-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> negatively impact aquatic life</a>.</p>
<p>To explore this further, the team documented the effects of this acidification in freshwater crustaceans&nbsp;&mdash;two species of Daphnia, which are known as water fleas. In ocean studies, acidification affects animals&rsquo; abilities to form shells, but these freshwater species had before not been studied. This team found that these crustaceans, when exposed to higher levels of CO2, were less able to sense predators and defend themselves.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This body of research still needs further exploration, but it is clear that climate change is contributing to acidification in freshwater bodies of water as well as the oceans. There is one spot of hope: it has been suggested by some studies that this process<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2087532-adding-rocks-to-oceans-could-de-acidify-water-and-save-coral/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> could be mitigated in the ocean</a>. As such, it is not out of reach to suggest that, as efforts to curb climate change continue, information like that found within this study could be used to do the same in freshwater.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img fl:hint-main-image="true" src="//inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/12/Plastic-Beach-889x592.jpg" alt="plastic beach, plastic waste, plastic pollution beach, plastic ocean, plastic pollution ocean, plastic pollution dog"></p>
<p>Over 200 countries just signed a <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/united-nations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">United Nations</a> resolution in Nairobi, <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/kenya/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kenya</a> to eliminate plastic waste in the world&rsquo;s oceans. The resolution is an important step towards establishing a legally binding treaty that would deal with the plastic pollution problem afflicting the world&rsquo;s oceans. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), there will be more plastic by weight in the world&rsquo;s oceans than fish by 2050 if current trends continue. </p>
<p><img src="//inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/12/Plastic-From-Seabirds-889x596.jpg" alt="plastic pollution, plastic pollution seabirds, plastic seabird stomachs, plastic pulled from seabird stomaches"></p>
<p>The resolution offers hope for the future: &ldquo;There is very strong language in this resolution,&rdquo; said Vidar Helgesen, Norway&rsquo;s environment minister, in an interview with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-environment-un-pollution/more-than-200-nations-promise-to-stop-ocean-plastic-waste-idUSKBN1E02F7?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=environmentNews" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters</a>. &ldquo;We now have an agreement to explore a legally binding instrument and other measures and that will be done at the international level over the next 18 months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although plastic pollution is a global problem, <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/norway" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Norway</a> was the country that initiated the UN resolution. &ldquo;We found micro plastics inside mussels, which is something we like to eat,&rdquo; said Helgesen. &ldquo;In January this year, a fairly rare species of whale was stranded on a beach because of exhaustion and they simply had to kill it. In its tummy they found 30 plastic bags.&rdquo; Even the most remote parts of the globe have not escaped the plastic menace. In the final episode of the acclaimed <a href="http://www.bbcearth.com/blueplanet2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue Planet II</a><em>, </em>plastic pollution is documented in isolated areas of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/antarctica/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Antarctica</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/china/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">China</a> is the world&rsquo;s largest producer of plastic waste and biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. However, the world&rsquo;s most populous country has taken the global lead in addressing these environmental crises. &ldquo;If there is one nation changing at the moment more than anyone else, it&rsquo;s China &hellip; the speed and determination of the government to change is enormous,&rdquo; said Erik Solheim, head of UNEP, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-environment-un-pollution/more-than-200-nations-promise-to-stop-ocean-plastic-waste-idUSKBN1E02F7?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=environmentNews" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters</a>. Meanwhile, the resolution, which was originally intended to have legally binding targets and timetables, was <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/policy/un-resolution-fighting-plastic-pollution-weakened-us-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weakened by the United States</a>, after Trump Administration officials rejected the stronger language.</p>
<p>Current American intransigence notwithstanding, Solheim envisions a future in which products and manufacturing systems are redesigned to use as little plastic as possible. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s abolish products that we do not need &hellip; if you go to tourist places like Bali, a huge amount of the plastic picked from the oceans are actually straws,&rdquo; said Solheim. Although there is much work to be done before a treaty is signed, several nations are already moving ahead to protect the environment. To mark the signing of the UN resolutions, 39 countries, including Chile, Oman, Sri Lanka and South Africa, adopted new commitments to reduce <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plastic/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plastic pollution</a>.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img fl:hint-main-image="true" src="https://inhabitat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/10/UK-gets-its-first-Seabin-in-Portsmouth-Harbour-3-889x500.jpg" alt="pollution, Australia, pastic, Seabin, overfishing, environment, innovation, green technology, green products, clean tech, "></p>
<p>UK waterways are about to get a lot cleaner with the launch of the world&rsquo;s first production Seabin in Portsmouth harbor. The device, which was developed by a pair of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/Australia" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Australian</a> surfers, works by sucking in various kinds of <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/pollution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pollution</a> (including oil) and spitting out clean water. The Seabin can collect approximately 1.5 kg of waste each day and has a capacity of 12 kg &mdash; and in a given year, a single bin can collect 20,000 plastic bottles or 83,000 <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/plastic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plastic</a> bags. </p>

<p>The Seabin was <a href="https://inhabitat.com/floating-seabin-sucks-up-ocean-waste-including-oil-and-detergents/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first unveiled in December</a> 2015. To fund the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/innovation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">invention</a>, founders Andrew Turton and Pete Ceglinski created an <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cleaning-the-oceans-one-marina-at-a-time#/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IndieGoGo campaign.</a> With little time to spare, the campaign exceeded its goal. </p>
<p>Equipped with $250,000, Turton and Ceglinski are now prepared to follow through with their plan, which entails cleaning up marinas with the <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/organic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">natural</a> fiber garbage bin and an automated, above-the-water pump. The device was designed with marine safety in mind &ndash; only debris and chemical pollution on the surface of the water is collected; fish and other aquatic creatures are left alone.</p>

The group is passionate about <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/environment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">environmental efforts</a> &ndash; not only have members pledged to give up meat every Monday, they only consume sustainable seafood. Now, they&rsquo;ve agreed to oversee the Seabin, which will improve the quality of water while protecting the cage of over 1,000 <a href="https://inhabitat.com/tag/overfishing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">oysters</a> near the pontoon.</p>

<p>The Seabin team are also conducting trials at Spain&rsquo;s Port Adriano and the Port of Helsinki (Finland). In early November, the innovative device will go on sale for &pound;3,000 ($3,957).</p>
